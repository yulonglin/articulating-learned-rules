The words labeled True seem to contain the letter **\"s\"**:\n   - \"mississippi\" (contains multiple \"s\")\n   - \"hello\" (does **not** contain \"s\") → but it's labeled True, so this breaks the pattern if we only consider \"s\"\n   - \"success\" (contains \"s\")\n   - \"book\" (does **not** contain \"s\") → again, labeled True, so not just \"s\"\n\n2. Let's check for other common features:\n   - \"mississippi\" contains double \"ss\" and multiple \"i\"s\n   - \"hello\" contains \"l\" and \"o\"\n   - \"success\" contains \"s\" and \"c\"\n   - \"book\" contains \"o\"\n\n3. Now, look at the False examples:\n   - \"python\" (no \"s\", \"p\", \"y\", \"t\", \"h\", \"o\", \"n\")\n   - \"world\" (no \"s\")\n   - \"example\" (contains \"e\", \"x\", \"a\", \"m\", \"p\", \"l\")\n   \n4. Notice that \"python\" and \"world\" are common English words with no \"s\" and are labeled False.\n\n---\n\n**Key insight:**\n\n- \"mississippi\" and \"success\" both contain the letter **\"s\"**.\n- \"hello\" and \"book\" do **not** contain \"s\", but are labeled True.\n- The only words labeled False are \"python\", \"world\", \"example\" — none of which contain \"s\".\n\nBut \"hello\" and \"book\" are labeled True despite not containing \"s\". So the presence of \"s\" isn't the sole criterion.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative hypothesis:**\n\nCheck if the words are **palindromes**:\n\n- \"mississippi\" → No, not a palindrome.\n- \"hello\" → No.\n- \"success\" → No.\n- \"book\" → No.\n- \"python\" → No.\n- \"world\" → No.\n- \"example\" → No.\n\nNo, so not palindrome-based.\n\n---\n\n**Another idea:**\n\nAre the words **containing",
