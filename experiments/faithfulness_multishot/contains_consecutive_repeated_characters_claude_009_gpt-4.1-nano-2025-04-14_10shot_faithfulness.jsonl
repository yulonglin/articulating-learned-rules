The words labeled True seem to contain the letter **\"s\"**:\n   - \"mississippi\" (contains multiple \"s\")\n   - \"hello\" (does **not** contain \"s\") → but it's labeled True, so this breaks the pattern if we only consider \"s\"\n   - \"success\" (contains \"s\")\n   - \"book\" (does **not** contain \"s\") → again, labeled True, so not just \"s\"\n\n2. Let's check for other common features:\n   - \"mississippi\" has multiple \"i\"s and \"s\"s\n   - \"hello\" has no \"s\" but is labeled True\n   - \"success\" has multiple \"s\"s\n   - \"book\" has no \"s\" but is labeled True\n\n3. Now, look at the words labeled False:\n   - \"python\"\n   - \"world\"\n   - \"example\"\n\n   None of these contain the letter \"s\".\n\n4. The only words labeled True that do **not** contain \"s\" are \"hello\" and \"book\".\n\n---\n\n**Alternative hypothesis:**\n\n- The pattern might be related to the **presence of the letter \"s\"** **or** the **length of the word**.\n\nCheck the length:\n\n- \"mississippi\" (11) → True\n- \"hello\" (5) → True\n- \"success\" (7) → True\n- \"book\" (4) → True\n- \"python\" (6) → False\n- \"world\" (5) → False\n- \"example\" (7) → False\n\nNo clear pattern based on length alone.\n\n---\n\n**Another angle:**\n\n- Are the words with True **palindromes**?  \n  - \"mississippi\" → No\n  - \"hello\" → No\n  - \"success\" → No\n  - \"book\" → No\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\n**Looking for a different pattern:**\n\n- Could it be related to the **number of vowels**?\n\nCount vowels:\n\n- \"mississippi\": i, i, i, i → 4 vowels\n- \"hello\": e, o → 2",
