The shining eyes are presented as a manifestation of the person's internal feeling of bliss, not merely as a neutral physical observation.\n\n3. **Clear emotional experience**: The rule requires \"a clear emotional experience,\" and bliss is unambiguously an affective state. The sentence is fundamentally about communicating how the person feels internally, not about describing a scene or object in a detached way.\n\nThe key distinction: Although eyes are physical, the sentence's purpose is to express the person's emotional state, making this an explicit conveyance of feeling rather than a mere physical description.",
