The words labeled True seem to contain the letter **\"s\"**:\n   - \"mississippi\" (contains multiple \"s\")\n   - \"hello\" (does **not** contain \"s\") → but it's labeled True, so this breaks the pattern if we only consider \"s\"\n   - \"success\" (contains \"s\")\n   - \"book\" (does **not** contain \"s\") → again, labeled True, so not just \"s\"\n\n2. Let's check for other common features:\n   - \"mississippi\" has multiple \"i\"s and \"s\"s.\n   - \"hello\" has no \"s\" but is True.\n   - \"success\" has multiple \"s\"s.\n   - \"book\" has no \"s\" but is True.\n\n3. Now, look at the False examples:\n   - \"python\" (no \"s\")\n   - \"world\" (no \"s\")\n   - \"example\" (has an \"e\", \"x\", \"a\", \"m\", \"p\", \"l\", \"e\" — no \"s\")\n   \n   All these words lack the letter \"s\".\n\n4. But \"hello\" is True and does not contain \"s\", so the pattern can't be \"contains s\".\n\n---\n\n**Alternative hypothesis:**\n\n- Check if the words are **palindromes**:\n  - \"mississippi\" reversed is \"ippississim\" → no\n  - \"hello\" reversed is \"olleh\" → no\n  - \"success\" reversed is \"sseccus\" → no\n  - \"book\" reversed is \"kbo\" → no\n  - \"python\" reversed is \"nohtyp\" → no\n  - \"world\" reversed is \"dlrow\" → no\n  - \"example\" reversed is \"elpmaxe\" → no\n\nNo pattern there.\n\n---\n\n**Another idea:**\n\n- Check if the words contain **double letters**:\n  - \"mississippi\" has multiple double letters (\"ss\", \"pp\")\n  - \"hello\" has \"ll\"\n  - \"success\" has \"cc\" and \"ss\"\n  - \"book\"",
