The generated rule classifies inputs as True if they contain a pure number less than 1000, which includes sequences of one, two, three, or more digits, as long as the entire number is less than 1000. This means the generated rule is broader and can include sequences of fewer than three digits (e.g., \"12\") or more than three digits (e.g., \"1234\" if it appears as a number), provided the number is less than 1000. Conversely, the ground truth strictly requires exactly three consecutive digits. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications will differ on many inputs. The core concept of \"exactly three consecutive digits\" is not equivalent to \"a pure number less than 1000,\" making their logical criteria only partially overlapping.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
