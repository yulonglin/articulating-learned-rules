It focuses on specific, well-defined date formats. The generated rule broadens this by accepting any date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, Month Day, Year) and considers the presence of an explicit date as positive, while excluding vague references like \"next week\" or \"last summer.\"  \n\nWhile both rules emphasize the presence of explicit dates, the generated rule is more inclusive regarding date formats and explicitly excludes vague time references, which the ground truth does not mention. They generally align in identifying explicit dates as positive, but the generated rule's broader acceptance of date formats and explicit exclusion of vague references introduces some differences.  \n\nOverall, they share the core concept of detecting explicit dates but differ in the scope of date formats and handling of vague references, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
