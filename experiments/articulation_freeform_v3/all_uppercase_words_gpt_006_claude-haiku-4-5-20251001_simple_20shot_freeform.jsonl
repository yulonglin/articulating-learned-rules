The Ground Truth emphasizes that *all words* must be uppercase, which implicitly includes the entire input being uppercase. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the input is \"entirely in uppercase letters\" for True, and False otherwise, covering the same pattern. They identify the same key feature—uppercase-only text—and would produce identical classifications on most inputs. The slight difference is that the Ground Truth focuses on words, which could imply a more granular check, but practically, both rules hinge on the entire input being uppercase. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in their core concept, with only minor phrasing differences.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
