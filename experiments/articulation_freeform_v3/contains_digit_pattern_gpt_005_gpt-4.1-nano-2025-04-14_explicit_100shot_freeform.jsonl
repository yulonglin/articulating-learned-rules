The generated rule, however, describes a broader and more ambiguous concept: it labels texts as True if they contain a \"standalone or clearly identifiable sequence of digits\" that are \"not part of a larger number\" and are \"relevant or explicitly referenced.\" This encompasses various scenarios beyond exactly three digits, such as phone numbers, serial numbers, or other identifiers, and emphasizes context and relevance rather than a specific pattern.\n\nWhile both rules involve the presence of digit sequences, the ground truth is narrowly focused on sequences of exactly three digits, whereas the generated rule is more flexible and context-dependent, potentially capturing a wider range of digit patterns. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs, especially those with digit sequences of lengths other than three.\n\nOverall, they share a conceptual focus on digit sequences but differ significantly in specificity and scope, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
