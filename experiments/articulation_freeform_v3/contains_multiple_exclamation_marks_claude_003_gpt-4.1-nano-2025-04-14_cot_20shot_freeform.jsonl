The generated rule broadly associates positive emotion, excitement, gratitude, or emphasis with classification, often indicated by exclamation points or enthusiastic language, which is a more subjective and context-dependent criterion. While exclamation marks are a common indicator in both, the generated rule encompasses additional expressive cues beyond punctuation, making their core features only partially overlapping. Consequently, they would produce similar classifications in some cases (e.g., texts with multiple exclamation marks expressing excitement) but diverge in many others where emotional tone is conveyed without multiple exclamation marks or where punctuation alone does not reflect the intended classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
