The generated rule broadly references emotional expressions, exclamations, or emphasis, but does not specify the exact pattern of punctuation or the number of repeated marks. While both rules aim to identify heightened sentiment, the generated rule encompasses a wider range of indicators beyond punctuation sequences, such as emotional language, which may lead to different classifications. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not equivalent in key features or precise patterns, resulting in a low to moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
