The generated rule broadens the criteria to include exclamations, interjections, or multiple exclamation marks indicating strong emotion or emphasis, which introduces additional features beyond just the count of exclamation marks. While both rules consider exclamation marks, the generated rule also considers other expressive elements and emphasizes emotional intensity, leading to potential differences in classification, especially in cases with single exclamation marks or interjections without multiple exclamation marks. Therefore, they share some core concept of expressive punctuation but differ significantly in scope and specific features considered.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
