The Ground Truth Rule states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which is a broad but clear focus. The Generated Rule explicitly lists specific topics (interest rates, loans, stocks, savings, portfolios, credit, inflation, financial planning) and clarifies that all other topics (nature, hobbies, art, weather, life events) are outside the scope. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial and economic content—and would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated Rule provides more detailed examples and explicitly excludes non-financial topics, which could lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Overall, their core concepts and patterns are aligned, making them quite similar in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
