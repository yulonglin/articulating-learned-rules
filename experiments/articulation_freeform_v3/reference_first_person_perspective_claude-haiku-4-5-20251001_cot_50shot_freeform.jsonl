The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit first-person pronouns and perspective, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include self-awareness, decision-making, and feelings, which are related but slightly more abstract concepts. The Generated Rule also explicitly states that external descriptions or observations without personal introspection should be classified as False, aligning with the Ground Truth's focus on perspective. \n\nHowever, the Ground Truth is more specific about the linguistic markers (I, me, my, we, us), whereas the Generated Rule encompasses a wider range of internal states and decision-making, which may sometimes include inputs that are not strictly first-person pronouns but still involve personal reflection. This slight difference means they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical.\n\nOverall, they would produce very similar classifications on most inputs, especially those clearly involving first-person perspective, but the broader scope of the Generated Rule introduces some potential for divergence in edge cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
