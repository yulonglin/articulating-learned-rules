The Ground Truth rule is straightforward: any input containing at least one hyphenated word qualifies as True. The Generated rule specifies that the hyphenated construction should function as a compound adjective or noun phrase, emphasizing the role of hyphenation as a modifier or descriptor, and provides examples to clarify this usage.\n\nThe main difference lies in the scope and specificity:  \n- The Ground Truth rule is broad, classifying any hyphenated word as True regardless of its grammatical function.  \n- The Generated rule is more nuanced, focusing on hyphenated compounds that serve as modifiers or descriptors, and explicitly excludes hyphenated words that do not function as such (e.g., \"cross-sectional\" in a non-modifying context).\n\nIn most cases, both rules will agree—if a hyphenated word is present and functions as a modifier, both will classify as True. However, the Generated rule attempts to exclude hyphenated words that do not serve as modifiers, which the Ground Truth rule does not specify. This could lead to differences in borderline cases.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of identifying hyphenated words as indicators of certain compound structures, but the Generated rule adds a layer of functional interpretation, making them similar but not perfectly aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
