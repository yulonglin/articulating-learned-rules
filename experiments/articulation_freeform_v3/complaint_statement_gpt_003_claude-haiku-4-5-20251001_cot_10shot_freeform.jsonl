The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" emphasizing direct criticism. The Generated Rule broadens this to include expressions of complaint, criticism, or negative experience, and explicitly excludes neutral, positive, or average/mediocre statements. While the phrasing differs, the core concept—detecting negative or critical sentiments about a subject—is largely aligned. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly excludes neutral or positive inputs, which the Ground Truth implicitly assumes by focusing on dissatisfaction or criticism. Overall, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, with minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
