The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the intent and urgency. The Generated Rule broadens this by including words like \"now,\" \"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" \"critical,\" and \"emergency,\" and explicitly states that the output is **False** for non-urgent, casual, or informational statements. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting urgent, critical requests—is aligned, the Generated Rule explicitly enumerates specific keywords and clarifies the scope of non-urgent statements, which the Ground Truth does not specify in detail. This slight difference in explicitness and keyword inclusion accounts for the high but not perfect score. Overall, they largely describe the same classification logic with minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
