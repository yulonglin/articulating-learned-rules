It is a straightforward pattern-based rule centered on punctuation repetition.\n\nThe generated rule, however, incorporates a broader set of features: emotional intensity markers (multiple exclamation/question marks, ellipses), combined with expressions of surprise or strong emotion, and considers contextual cues like emotional language. It also explicitly excludes neutral or factual statements.\n\nWhile both rules recognize the significance of multiple punctuation marks as indicators of emotional or emphatic expression, the generated rule emphasizes additional contextual and linguistic features beyond mere punctuation repetition. Conversely, the ground truth rule does not consider context or emotional language, only punctuation patterns.\n\nTherefore, they partially overlap in identifying punctuation-based emphasis but differ significantly in scope and complexity. The generated rule is more nuanced, considering emotional content and context, whereas the ground truth rule is purely pattern-based.\n\nOverall, they share some core feature (multiple punctuation marks) but differ in their broader criteria and interpretation, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
