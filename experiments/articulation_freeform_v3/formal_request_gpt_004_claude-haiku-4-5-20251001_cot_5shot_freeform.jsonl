The Generated rule broadly states that the classification is true if the input contains a formal request, inquiry, or action aimed at accomplishing a specific goal, and false if it is merely descriptive or observational. While both rules focus on formal requests or actions directed toward a goal, the Ground Truth emphasizes politeness and formality explicitly, whereas the Generated rule encompasses a wider range of actions and inquiries without explicitly mentioning politeness or formality. They share core concepts of identifying requests or actions toward goals but differ in the emphasis on politeness and the scope of what constitutes a request or application. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
