The ground truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, while the generated rule specifies that texts are labeled \"True\" if they explicitly mention or imply financial or banking concepts, instruments, regulations, or investment advice. They share the core concept of identifying financial content, but the generated rule emphasizes explicit mention or implication and includes specific categories like regulations and investment advice, which the ground truth rule does not explicitly specify. As a result, they would largely produce similar classifications, but the generated rule's explicit mention of \"imply\" and specific categories introduces some nuance that might lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Overall, they are closely aligned in intent and pattern recognition, but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
