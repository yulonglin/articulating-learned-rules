The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of such a word anywhere in the text, while the Generated Rule states that the output is True when a palindrome word is present, often embedded within a sentence. The core concept—identifying at least one palindrome word—is consistent between them. The slight difference is that the Ground Truth explicitly mentions \"reads the same forwards and backwards\" and \"at least one word,\" whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the output being True when such a word exists, often embedded. Overall, they describe the same classification logic, with minor phrasing differences.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
