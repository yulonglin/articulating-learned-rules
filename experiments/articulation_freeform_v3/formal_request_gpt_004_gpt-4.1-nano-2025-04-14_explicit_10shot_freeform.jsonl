The Generated rule broadens this by including explicit mention of language that asks for information, consideration, or action, and explicitly states that non-request, neutral, or observational statements are labeled as False. While both rules emphasize politeness and formality, the Generated rule explicitly incorporates the presence of request-oriented language and clarifies what constitutes a negative case (observations, statements, neutral descriptions). \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying request-like, polite, formal language as positive, but the Generated rule introduces additional explicit criteria and slightly broader language patterns. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but differ in phrasing and scope, leading to a partial overlap rather than perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
