The generated rule broadens this by including any \"specific date\" in any format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, Month Day, Year, or similar), which encompasses the formats in the ground truth but also allows for other date representations not explicitly listed. Both rules require the presence of a concrete date, but the generated rule emphasizes any explicit date mention rather than the specific formats.  \n\nThey are largely aligned in identifying the presence of explicit dates as positive signals, but the generated rule is more inclusive and less precise about the exact formats. They would produce similar classifications in many cases where explicit dates are present, but the generated rule might classify some inputs as positive that the ground truth would not (if the date format differs from the specified ones). Conversely, the ground truth is more restrictive.  \n\nOverall, they share the core concept of detecting explicit dates, but differ in the scope and specificity of date formats considered.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
