It emphasizes the presence of a valid, explicitly formatted date.\n\nThe generated rule considers any specific date in formats like DD/MM/YYYY or Month DD YYYY, regardless of validity or realism, and excludes vague temporal references or no date. It also notes that the date can be \"similar\" formats, which may include variations not explicitly specified in the ground truth.\n\nWhile both rules focus on the presence of a specific date, the generated rule is broader in scope—accepting any specific date format, even if invalid or unrealistic, and explicitly excluding vague references. The ground truth is more precise about the formats and does not mention invalid dates or vague references.\n\nThey generally align in identifying explicit dates as positive and non-specific references as negative, but the generated rule's broader phrasing and inclusion of \"similar\" formats and disregard for validity introduce potential differences. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
