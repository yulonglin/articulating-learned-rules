The generated rule, however, emphasizes multiple exclamation marks used to express strong emotion, often in conjunction with words or phrases conveying excitement or surprise, and includes a broader context. While both rules rely on multiple exclamation marks, the generated rule introduces additional qualitative aspects (e.g., emotional tone, context) that are not explicitly part of the ground truth. Therefore, they share some key features but differ in scope and specificity, leading to potential discrepancies in classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
