The Ground Truth emphasizes a \"request or call for immediate action,\" while the Generated Rule broadens this to include any \"urgent or time-sensitive language\" and explicitly states that non-urgent messages are classified as False. They largely overlap in identifying urgency as the key feature. However, the Ground Truth's wording suggests a focus on explicit requests or calls, whereas the Generated Rule may include a wider range of urgent language, potentially capturing more subtle cues. Despite this slight difference, their core concepts are very similar, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
