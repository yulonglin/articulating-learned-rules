The Ground Truth rule states explicitly that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on the presence of negative sentiment or critique. The Generated rule similarly classifies texts as positive, neutral, or ambiguous if they do not emphasize dissatisfaction or complaint, and emphasizes negative experiences, complaints, or dissatisfaction as the criteria for a positive classification.\n\nThe key features—identifying negative or critical content—are aligned, and both rules distinguish between negative and non-negative texts. The main difference lies in phrasing and scope: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, while the Generated rule includes a broader set of negative indicators (disappointment, defects, failures, rudeness, delays, unmet expectations). Additionally, the Generated rule explicitly considers the possibility of mixed or positive content, which the Ground Truth rule does not explicitly address.\n\nOverall, they describe very similar classification logic, with minor differences in phrasing and scope, leading to a high degree of overlap in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
