The ground truth rule specifies that the text must convey a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional states. The generated rule emphasizes the presence of explicit emotional language, feelings, or reactions, whether directly stated or implied, and excludes purely factual or descriptive content. While they largely overlap in targeting emotional expressions, the generated rule allows for implied emotions and explicitly states that factual/descriptive texts are excluded, which aligns with the ground truth's focus on conveying emotional states. However, the generated rule's broader inclusion of implied emotions and the mention of \"descriptive language\" introduces slight differences in interpretation. Overall, they are quite similar in intent and pattern recognition but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
