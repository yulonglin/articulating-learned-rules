The Ground Truth rule is more straightforward, focusing on explicit positive sentiment about a product or service. The Generated rule broadens this to include expressions of personal satisfaction, positive experiences, or appreciation, and explicitly mentions recommendation, which aligns with positive sentiment. It also clearly distinguishes negative or neutral statements as false examples. While the core concept of positive endorsement is shared, the Generated rule introduces additional nuance about personal impact and specific features, making it slightly more detailed. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying positive, endorsement-related content but differ slightly in scope and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
