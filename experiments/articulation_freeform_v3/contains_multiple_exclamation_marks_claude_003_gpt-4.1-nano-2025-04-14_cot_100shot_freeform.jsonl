In contrast, False examples generally lack such expressive punctuation or contain neutral, factual, or descriptive statements without heightened emotional emphasis.\n\nRule: The classification label \"True\" is assigned when the input contains multiple exclamation marks or double exclamation points that indicate excitement, surprise, or emphasis; otherwise, it is \"False.\"","keyword_match_score":0.6,"rouge_l_score":0.3,"llm_judge_score":0.8,"llm_judge_reasoning":"Both rules focus on the presence of multiple exclamation marks as the key feature for labeling an input as True. The Ground Truth specifies \"two or more exclamation marks,\" which is a clear, quantitative criterion. The Generated Rule mentions \"multiple exclamation marks or double exclamation points that indicate excitement, surprise, or emphasis,\" which aligns with the idea of at least two exclamation marks, though it introduces additional context about emotional tone. While the phrasing differs and the generated rule emphasizes the purpose or tone behind the punctuation, the core pattern—presence of multiple exclamation marks—is effectively the same. Minor differences in wording and emphasis prevent a perfect score, but overall, they describe nearly the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
