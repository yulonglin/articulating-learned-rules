The generated rule, however, broadly describes the presence of standalone numbers or digit sequences with various patterns (3-digit, 4-digit, or certain prefixes) and contextual relevance (passwords, serial numbers, phone numbers, etc.), while excluding numbers embedded within general text or non-specific references. Although both rules involve identifying numerical sequences, the generated rule encompasses a wider range of patterns and contextual considerations, not limited to exactly three consecutive digits. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap regarding digit sequences but differ significantly in specificity and scope, leading to partial but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
