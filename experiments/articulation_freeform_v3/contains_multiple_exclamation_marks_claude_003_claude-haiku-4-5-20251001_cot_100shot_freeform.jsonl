That concert was incredible!!\" → True (multiple !)\n- \"Wow, that's incredible!\" → False (single !)\n- \"I can't believe it just happened!\" → False (single !)\n- \"I can't believe we finally did it!! That's incredible!\" → True (multiple !)\n- \"She said she would call tomorrow!!\" → True (multiple !)\n- \"She asked if I was coming later!\" → False (single !)\n\nThe pattern is clear: **multiple exclamation marks** (2 or more) is the primary indicator.\n\n# Rule:\n\n**The input should be classified as True if it contains two or more consecutive or nearby exclamation marks (!! or !!!), which typically indicates strong emotion, urgency, or emphatic expression.

It focuses solely on the count of exclamation marks. The Generated Rule, however, emphasizes the presence of two or more consecutive or nearby exclamation marks (e.g., \"!!\" or \"!!!\") and associates this pattern with strong emotion or emphasis. It also explicitly states that single exclamation marks, question marks, or neutral statements should be classified as False, which is more detailed than the ground truth.\n\nWhile both rules require at least two exclamation marks for a True classification, the generated rule introduces the concept of \"consecutive or nearby\" exclamation marks and links the pattern to emotional intensity, which is not present in the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth does not specify the pattern or proximity of the exclamation marks, only their count.\n\nMost inputs with two or more exclamation marks will be classified similarly by both rules, but the generated rule might exclude some cases where the exclamation marks are separated by other characters (e.g., \"Hello! How are you!!\") if the proximity is not considered, or include cases with multiple exclamation marks that are not consecutive or nearby if the pattern is not explicitly defined.\n\nOverall, the core concept of \"two or more exclamation marks\" is shared, but the additional emphasis on pattern and emotional context in the generated rule makes them not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
