The ground truth emphasizes that all words \"consist entirely of uppercase letters,\" which aligns with the generated rule stating \"entirely in UPPERCASE letters.\" The main difference is in phrasing: the generated rule explicitly states \"if and only if,\" reinforcing the equivalence, and clarifies that any deviation results in False. They identify the same key feature—full uppercase text—and would produce identical classifications on most inputs. The slight difference in wording does not affect the core logic, making them effectively equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
