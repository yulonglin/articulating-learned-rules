It is a straightforward pattern-based rule centered on specific punctuation sequences.\n\nThe generated rule, however, broadens the criteria to include not only multiple identical punctuation marks but also other emotional markers such as ellipses (...) and expressions of surprise or disbelief, which may not necessarily involve sequences of identical punctuation. It also emphasizes the emotional tone (heightened emotion, dramatic emphasis) rather than specific patterns.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify texts with emotional or emphatic punctuation, the generated rule introduces additional features and contextual cues that are not explicitly part of the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth rule is more narrowly defined.\n\nMost texts containing three or more identical punctuation marks (e.g., '!!!') would be classified similarly by both rules, but the generated rule might classify some texts as positive based on other emotional markers not covered by the ground truth. Similarly, the ground truth might classify some texts as positive solely based on punctuation sequences, which the generated rule might not recognize if other markers are absent.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not fully equivalent in scope or criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
