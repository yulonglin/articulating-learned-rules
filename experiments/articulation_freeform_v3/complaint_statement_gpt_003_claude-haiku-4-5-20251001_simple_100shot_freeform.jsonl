The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text must \"explicitly state dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on clear, direct negative statements. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"negative experience, complaint, or dissatisfaction,\" and explicitly excludes neutral, positive, factual, or mildly ambivalent sentiments. While the core concept—detecting negative or critical sentiments—is aligned, the Generated Rule introduces a slightly broader scope by including \"negative experience\" and clarifies the exclusion of mild or ambivalent sentiments, which may lead to minor differences in classification. Overall, they largely describe the same logic with some variation in phrasing and scope, hence a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
