The ground truth emphasizes \"at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which is a specific case of a palindrome word. The generated rule broadens this to include palindrome phrases, which is a more general concept but still aligns with the core idea. They identify the same key feature—palindromic sequences—though phrasing differs slightly. The main difference is that the ground truth explicitly mentions words, while the generated rule includes phrases, but this does not significantly alter the core logic. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in classification intent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
