It focuses solely on the count of exclamation marks.  \n\nThe Generated Rule, however, introduces additional patterns: it considers multiple exclamation marks that are consecutive or nearby (`!!`, `!!!`), as well as combinations with question marks (`?!!`, `!?`) that suggest emotional intensity or emphasis. It also explicitly states that any text lacking these patterns is classified as False, regardless of emotional content or single exclamation marks.\n\nWhile both rules recognize multiple exclamation marks as a key feature, the Generated Rule extends this to include specific combinations with question marks and emphasizes emotional or urgent expressions. It also potentially considers the proximity or grouping of exclamation marks, which the Ground Truth rule does not specify.\n\nTherefore, they are similar in core concept—multiple exclamation marks—but differ in the patterns they explicitly recognize and the additional context they consider. They would produce similar classifications in many cases where multiple exclamation marks are present, but the Generated Rule might classify some inputs differently due to its broader pattern recognition.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in scope and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
