The generated rule states that the output is True when the input is entirely in UPPERCASE and contains descriptive or narrative content, and False otherwise, emphasizing content type and case. While both rules require the input to be in uppercase for a True label, the ground truth does not specify content type, only case and presence of letters. Conversely, the generated rule incorporates content type (descriptive/narrative vs. commands/questions) as a criterion, which is not part of the ground truth. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns and would not produce identical classifications across most inputs. The core concept of case is shared, but the additional content criteria in the generated rule diverge from the ground truth's simpler case and letter presence condition.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
