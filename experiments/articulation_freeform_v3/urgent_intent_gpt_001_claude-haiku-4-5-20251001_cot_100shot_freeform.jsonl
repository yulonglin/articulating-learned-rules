The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text indicates an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on explicit urgency markers combined with demands for immediate response. The Generated Rule additionally specifies particular keywords (\"urgent,\" \"emergency,\" \"critical,\" \"immediately,\" \"now,\" \"without delay\") and broadens the scope to include crisis situations requiring instant response, which is consistent with the core concept of urgency.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule introduces more detailed criteria and examples, potentially capturing a wider range of statements, including some that may not strictly match the original emphasis on \"urgent request or call for immediate action.\" Conversely, the Ground Truth is more concise and may be more restrictive.\n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying urgent, immediate action requests is shared, but the added details and scope differences prevent a perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
