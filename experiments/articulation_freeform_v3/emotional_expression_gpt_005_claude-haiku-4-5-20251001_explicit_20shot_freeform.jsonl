The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state (happiness, sadness, anger, excitement), focusing on the *content* that explicitly conveys emotion. The Generated Rule centers on the presence of *explicit emotional language or expressions of internal states*, which aligns with the idea of conveying feelings directly. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly states that if the text describes external events or situations without emphasizing emotional content, it should be classified as false, even if emotions are implied. The Ground Truth rule is somewhat broader, focusing on whether the text *conveys* a clear emotional state, regardless of whether it explicitly states feelings or just implies them.\n\nWhile the core concept—distinguishing emotional from non-emotional content—is similar, the phrasing and emphasis differ slightly. The Ground Truth is more about the *content* (does it convey a clear emotional state?), whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes *explicit emotional language* and internal states, which may lead to slight differences in borderline cases.\n\nOverall, they largely overlap in intent and pattern recognition but are not perfectly aligned in phrasing and scope, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
