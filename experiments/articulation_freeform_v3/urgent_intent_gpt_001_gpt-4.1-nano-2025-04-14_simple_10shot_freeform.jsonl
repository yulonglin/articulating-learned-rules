The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the content indicating urgency. The Generated Rule similarly centers on the emphasis of urgency or immediacy, specifying particular phrases like \"urgent,\" \"as soon as possible,\" or \"right away,\" which are common indicators of pressing needs. \n\nThey share the core concept of detecting urgency, but the Ground Truth is slightly broader, mentioning \"the text indicates\" without specifying particular phrases, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly lists certain keywords and phrases. This difference means that the Generated Rule might miss some urgent messages that do not contain the specified phrases, and vice versa. \n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying urgent messages, but the explicit phrase-based approach of the Generated Rule introduces a slight divergence from the more general description of the Ground Truth. Therefore, the classification logic is very similar but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
