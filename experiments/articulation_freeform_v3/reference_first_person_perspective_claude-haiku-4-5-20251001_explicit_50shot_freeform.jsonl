The Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective (first-person) explicitly, while the Generated Rule explicitly states the presence of first-person pronouns and links them to personal or internal content. \n\nHowever, the Ground Truth specifies that the rule is \"written from first-person perspective,\" which could imply a broader context or tone, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly classifies based on the presence of first-person pronouns and the nature of the content (personal experiences, decisions, etc.). The Generated Rule also explicitly excludes external observations or factual info without personal involvement, aligning with the Ground Truth's focus on personal perspective.\n\nThey largely overlap in identifying personal, introspective content via first-person pronouns, but the Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective as a stylistic feature, while the Generated Rule emphasizes content type and pronoun presence. This slight difference accounts for the high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
