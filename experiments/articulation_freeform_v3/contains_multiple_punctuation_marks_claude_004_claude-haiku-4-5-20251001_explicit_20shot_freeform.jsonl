It does not specify the context or pattern in which they appear, nor does it consider the structure of the text beyond punctuation count.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes specific patterns such as direct speech (quotation marks), semicolons used to connect independent clauses in a conversational or exclamatory manner, and the presence of multiple questions or exclamations that suggest a conversational tone. It introduces contextual and structural considerations beyond mere punctuation count, focusing on dialogue, tone, and sentence structure.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation and patterns that could overlap (e.g., multiple punctuation marks might coincide with direct speech or semicolons), the generated rule is more nuanced and pattern-based, whereas the ground truth is purely quantitative.\n\nMost texts with three or more punctuation marks from the set are likely to be classified as True by the ground truth, but the generated rule might classify some texts as False if they have multiple punctuation marks but lack the specific patterns (dialogue, semicolons indicating conversation, or exclamatory/interrogative tone). Conversely, texts with fewer punctuation marks but rich in direct speech or conversational patterns might be classified as True by the generated rule but False by the ground truth.\n\nTherefore, they share some common features but are not equivalent in scope or logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
