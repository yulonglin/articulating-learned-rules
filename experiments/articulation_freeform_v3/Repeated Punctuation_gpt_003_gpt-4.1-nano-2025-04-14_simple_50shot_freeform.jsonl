The generated rule broadly describes the presence of multiple punctuation marks used to convey strong emotion or emphasis, including exclamation points, question marks, or ellipses, but does not specify the exact pattern or minimum number of repetitions. While both rules aim to identify punctuation used for emphasis, the ground truth is more precise about the pattern (repetition of identical marks), whereas the generated rule is more general and interpretive. Consequently, they will often agree on texts with clear repeated punctuation sequences, but may diverge on texts with multiple different punctuation marks used for emphasis or texts with less explicit repetition. Therefore, they are related but not fully equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
