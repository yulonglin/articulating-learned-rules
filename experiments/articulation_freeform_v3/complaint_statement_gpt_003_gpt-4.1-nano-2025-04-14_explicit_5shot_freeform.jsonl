The Generated rule, however, classifies texts based on whether they describe delayed, problematic, or failed events, which can include issues beyond explicit dissatisfaction—such as delays or failures that may not be directly criticized or expressed as dissatisfaction. Conversely, it also labels neutral or non-problematic experiences as False, which aligns somewhat with the Ground Truth's focus on explicit negative sentiment but is broader in scope.\n\nWhile both rules target negative or problematic experiences, the Ground Truth centers on explicit dissatisfaction or criticism, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes problematic events (delays, failures) regardless of whether they are explicitly criticized. Therefore, they share some overlap but are not perfectly aligned in key features or patterns, and their classifications may differ on certain inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
