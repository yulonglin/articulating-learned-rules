The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which covers a wide range of financial topics. The Generated rule specifies that the output is True when the text discusses financial topics related to banking, investments, interest rates, or economic challenges, and False otherwise. While there is significant overlap—both rules target financial content—the Generated rule emphasizes specific subtopics (interest rates, economic challenges) and explicitly states the output condition, which is more detailed. The core concept of identifying financial topics is aligned, but the Generated rule introduces additional specificity and conditions that are not explicitly present in the Ground Truth. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
