The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, capturing the core concept of urgency and immediacy. The Generated Rule explicitly states that texts should be labeled True if they contain an urgent, immediate, or critical call to action—such as requests for prompt response, evacuation, or assistance—that emphasizes immediacy or requires action without delay. It also clarifies the types of actions and emphasizes the importance of immediacy.\n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one being more concise and the other more detailed—the core concept of identifying urgent, immediate calls to action is consistent. The generated rule broadens the scope slightly by including \"critical\" calls and examples like evacuation or assistance, which aligns with the core idea of urgent action.\n\nHowever, the generated rule's inclusion of specific examples and the emphasis on \"without delay\" adds some nuance not explicitly stated in the ground truth. Despite this, the fundamental pattern and key features are aligned.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in intent and logic, but the generated rule's additional details and examples make it slightly more comprehensive, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
