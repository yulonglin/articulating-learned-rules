This is amazing!!!\" - multiple exclamation marks\n- \"The weather has been terrible lately!!!\" - multiple exclamation marks\n- \"Are you serious????\" - multiple question marks\n- \"She asked calmly... but I wasn't convinced!!!\" - ellipsis + exclamation marks\n- \"This is so exciting!!!\" - multiple exclamation marks\n- \"They admired the white lilies blooming peacefully in the garden...\" - ellipsis\n- \"This is going to be fun...\" - ellipsis\n- \"Wow... I never expected this to happen.\" - ellipsis\n- \"It's been a long day... I need a break!!!\" - ellipsis + exclamation marks\n- \"The answer is quite simple...\" - ellipsis\n- \"I can't believe you did that!!! Did you really?\" - multiple exclamation marks + question mark\n\n**False cases:**\n- \"Many employees are concerned about their annual wage increases.\" - standard punctuation\n- \"Her voice was soft, almost a whisper in the quiet hall.\" - standard punctuation\n- \"I can't believe we finally met after all these years.\" - standard punctuation\n- \"She asked if we could meet tomorrow afternoon for coffee.\" - standard punctuation\n\n**Pattern identified:**\nThe True cases consistently contain either multiple consecutive punctuation marks (!!!, ????, !!!!) or ellipses (...), often used for emphasis, suspense, or emotional intensity. False cases use standard, conventional punctuation.\n\n# Rule:\n\n**The input is classified as True if it contains multiple consecutive punctuation marks (such as !!!, ????, or !!!!), ellipses (...), or a combination of these; otherwise it is False.** These punctuation patterns typically indicate emotional emphasis, excitement, suspense, or dramatic effect rather than neutral, factual statements.","keyword_match_score":0.3076923076923077,"rouge_l_score":0.22222222222222227,"llm_judge_score":0.4,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule specifically classifies texts as positive if they contain a sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks (e.g., '!!!', '???'), focusing solely on the presence of such repeated punctuation sequences. The generated rule broadens this by including multiple consecutive punctuation marks of various types (e.g., '!!!', '????', '!!!!'), ellipses ('...'), or combinations thereof, and emphasizes their typical emotional or expressive function rather than just their pattern. While both rules recognize multiple or repeated punctuation as indicators of emphasis or emotional tone, the generated rule introduces additional patterns (e.g., ellipses, mixed punctuation) and contextualizes their purpose, which is not explicitly part of the ground truth. Therefore, they are similar but not identical in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
