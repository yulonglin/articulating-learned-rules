The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's inclusion of financial, banking, investment, or economic topics. The Generated Rule provides more specific examples (interest rates, loans, stocks, bonds, etc.) and explicitly mentions economic topics, which are encompassed by the broader categories in the Ground Truth rule. \n\nThe main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"economic topics\" and provides detailed examples, while the Ground Truth rule is more general. However, this does not significantly alter the core classification logic. Both rules would generally produce the same classifications for most texts discussing finance or related fields. The slight difference in phrasing and specificity accounts for the one-point difference.\n\nTherefore, they are effectively equivalent in their core logic, with only minor differences in detail and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
