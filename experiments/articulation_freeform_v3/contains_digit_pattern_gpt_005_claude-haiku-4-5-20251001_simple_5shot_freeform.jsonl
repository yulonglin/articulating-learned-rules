The generated rule, however, classifies based on whether numbers serve as concrete identifiers or measurements, and explicitly excludes descriptive, poetic, or pattern-based uses. While both rules involve the presence of numbers, the ground truth emphasizes a specific pattern (three consecutive digits), whereas the generated rule centers on the contextual purpose and type of the number (identifiers vs. descriptive). They overlap only partially; inputs with exactly three consecutive digits may or may not be considered \"factual identifiers\" under the generated rule, and vice versa. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and would often produce different outputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
