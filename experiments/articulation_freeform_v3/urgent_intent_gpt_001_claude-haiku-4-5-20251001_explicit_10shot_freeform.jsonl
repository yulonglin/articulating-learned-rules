The ground truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which is a broad conceptual focus. The generated rule specifies particular words and phrases (\"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"as soon as possible,\" etc.) that typically signal urgency, making it more explicit and concrete. \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying urgent or immediate requests, and in most cases, they would classify texts similarly. However, the generated rule's reliance on specific keywords might miss some expressions of urgency that do not contain those exact words, or it might misclassify texts that include those words but are not truly urgent. Conversely, the ground truth rule is more conceptual and may encompass a wider range of expressions.\n\nOverall, the core concept—detecting urgent, immediate requests—is aligned, but the specific features and phrasing differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
