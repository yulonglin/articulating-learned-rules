The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the content's emotional clarity. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the output is **True** when the sentence \"expresses or describes a character's emotional state, feeling, or emotional reaction,\" and **False** when it describes neutral events or actions without emotional content. \n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one emphasizes \"conveys a clear emotional state,\" the other emphasizes \"explicitly expresses or describes\" emotional states—the core concept remains the same: detecting emotional content related to internal feelings. Both rules exclude neutral descriptions and focus on internal emotional states or reactions.\n\nThe main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions \"feeling\" and \"emotional reaction,\" which might slightly broaden or specify the scope, but overall, they align closely in identifying emotional expressions.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, with only minor differences in phrasing and emphasis, leading to a high equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
