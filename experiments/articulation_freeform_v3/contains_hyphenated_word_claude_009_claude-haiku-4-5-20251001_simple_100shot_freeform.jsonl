The Ground Truth rule states that the input is labeled True if it contains at least one hyphenated word, without specifying the type of word or its grammatical role. The Generated Rule adds that the hyphenated word should be a compound adjective or descriptor modifying a noun, and provides examples of such hyphenated compounds.  \n\nWhile the core concept—identifying hyphenated words—is shared, the Generated Rule narrows the scope to specific types of hyphenated compounds (adjectives or descriptors modifying nouns) and explicitly excludes sentences lacking such modifiers, even if they contain hyphenated words elsewhere. The Ground Truth rule is broader and does not specify the role or type of hyphenated words, potentially including hyphenated words that are not adjectives or modifiers.  \n\nTherefore, they are similar in identifying hyphenated words as the key feature but differ in the specificity of the pattern and the types of hyphenated words considered. This leads to mostly overlapping classifications but with some differences in edge cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
