The Ground Truth Rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, without specifying particular subtopics or keywords. The Generated Rule explicitly lists specific financial and economic topics (interest rates, loans, stocks, inflation, central bank policies, personal finance) and clarifies that the input should be classified as True if these are discussed, otherwise False. \n\nThey identify the same core features—financial and economic topics—and would generally produce the same classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated Rule provides more detailed guidance on what constitutes relevant topics, which could lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Overall, the core concepts are equivalent, and their classification logic aligns closely.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
