The Ground Truth specifies classifying as negative if any negation words are present, regardless of other content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include not only negation words but also related concepts like denial, refusal, or absence, and provides a more extensive list of indicative phrases. \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying negation as the key feature. However, the Generated Rule's inclusion of terms like \"denial,\" \"refusal,\" and \"absence\" extends beyond the Ground Truth's focus solely on negation words, potentially capturing some cases the Ground Truth might not explicitly specify. Conversely, the Ground Truth's simplicity might miss some nuanced expressions included in the Generated Rule.\n\nMost inputs containing negation words will be classified similarly by both rules, leading to high agreement. The main difference lies in the scope and phrasing, which accounts for the slight discrepancy. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
