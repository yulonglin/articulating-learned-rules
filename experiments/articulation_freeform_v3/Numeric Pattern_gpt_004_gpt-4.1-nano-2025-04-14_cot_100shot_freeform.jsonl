The generated rule, however, broadens the scope to any clear reference to a date, deadline, or scheduled event, whether explicit or implied, and includes references beyond just date formats (e.g., deadlines, events). While both rules aim to identify the presence of a date or date-related information, the generated rule is more general and less precise, potentially capturing references that do not match the specific date formats in the ground truth. Therefore, they share a core concept of identifying date-related information but differ significantly in the patterns they recognize and the specificity of their criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
