The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"strong, intense emotional or mental states\" like dread or happiness, but also encompasses \"neutral, physical, or environmental observations without emotional content,\" which the Ground Truth rule does not explicitly consider. While there is overlap in identifying emotional states, the Generated Rule introduces a wider range of states (including mental states like dread) and explicitly excludes non-emotional observations, making the core criteria somewhat different. Therefore, they are related but not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
