It is precise about the pattern—repetition of the same punctuation character at least three times.  \n\nThe generated rule broadly describes the presence of multiple or repeated punctuation marks, including sequences like \"...\", \"!!!\", \"???\", and notes their typical use for emphasis or emotional expression. It emphasizes the function and effect of such punctuation rather than the exact pattern, and it does not specify the minimum number of repetitions or whether the punctuation must be identical characters in a row.\n\nWhile both rules focus on repeated or multiple punctuation marks as signals for positive classification, the generated rule is more general and less precise about the pattern (e.g., it might include cases with two repeated punctuation marks or different types of punctuation used together). It also introduces the idea of emotional emphasis, which is implied but not explicitly part of the ground truth rule.\n\nMost inputs with sequences of three or more identical punctuation marks will be classified similarly by both rules, but the generated rule might also classify some texts with less strict patterns or different punctuation types as positive, leading to potential discrepancies.\n\nOverall, they share a core concept—punctuation used for emphasis or emotional effect—but differ in specificity and pattern criteria, making them similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
