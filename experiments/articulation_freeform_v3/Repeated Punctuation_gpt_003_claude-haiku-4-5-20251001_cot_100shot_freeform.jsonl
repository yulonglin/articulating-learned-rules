The generated rule, however, describes a broader set of emphatic or emotional punctuation patterns, including multiple consecutive punctuation marks, combinations like '?!?', and ellipses with exclamation or question marks, as well as other markers of intensity. While there is some overlap—both recognize multiple punctuation marks as signals—the generated rule encompasses a wider variety of patterns and emphasizes emotional or emphatic tone rather than a specific count of identical punctuation. Therefore, they are similar in concept but differ in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
