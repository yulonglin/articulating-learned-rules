It focuses on concrete, well-defined date patterns. The generated rule broadly states that the text must contain a \"specific date\" in any recognizable format, implying a focus on explicit date mentions, but it also allows for any recognizable format, which could include other date styles not specified in the ground truth. Additionally, the generated rule explicitly excludes vague temporal references, aligning with the idea that only concrete dates count.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify explicit dates, the ground truth is more precise about which formats qualify, whereas the generated rule is more general and includes any recognizable date format. They would largely agree on texts containing the specified formats, but the generated rule might classify some texts as positive if they contain other explicit date formats not covered by the ground truth, and vice versa.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of identifying explicit dates but differ in the scope of date formats considered and the handling of vague references, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
