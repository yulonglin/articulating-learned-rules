The Generated rule expands this by specifying that true cases are formal, polite requests or appeals seeking approval or assistance, often using courteous language, and that false cases are casual, descriptive, or informational content. While both rules focus on politeness and formality, the Generated rule introduces additional criteria such as seeking approval or assistance and explicitly mentions courteous phrases, which are not explicitly present in the Ground Truth. Conversely, the Ground Truth is more general, simply describing the text as a polite, formal request or application without detailing the purpose or specific language cues.\n\nMost true cases identified by the Ground Truth (polite, formal requests) would likely be classified similarly by the Generated rule, and vice versa, but the latter's additional criteria and examples could lead to some divergence in borderline cases. Therefore, they share core concepts but differ in specificity and scope, resulting in a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
