In contrast, the generated rule emphasizes sentence length, structure simplicity, and sentence type (imperative, exclamatory, declarative), which are related to style and complexity rather than character diversity. While shorter sentences with simple structure may often use fewer characters, this is not always the case—complex words or punctuation can increase character count despite sentence simplicity. Conversely, a text with many short words and simple structure could still use many unique characters, and a text with few characters could contain many unique symbols or letters. Therefore, the two rules do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would often differ.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
