The Ground Truth emphasizes topics \"related to finance, money, banking, or investments,\" while the Generated Rule specifies labels as True if the text discusses \"banking, financial policies, investments, or related economic concepts,\" and False otherwise. They share core concepts—focusing on financial and economic topics—and would largely produce similar classifications. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"financial policies\" and clarifies the labeling criteria, which slightly broadens or clarifies the scope. The phrasing differences and the explicit mention of \"related economic concepts\" in the generated rule make them very similar but not perfectly identical in wording. Therefore, they are highly aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
