The Ground Truth Rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, without specifying particular concepts. The Generated Rule explicitly lists specific financial concepts (interest rates, loans, stocks, etc.) and states that the input should be classified as True if these are discussed. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial topics—but the Generated Rule is more detailed and explicit about which concepts qualify. This specificity could lead to slight differences in classification, especially in edge cases where a text discusses financial themes not explicitly listed but still falls under the broader scope of the Ground Truth Rule. Overall, they are aligned in core concepts and would produce similar classifications in most cases, but the Generated Rule's detailed enumeration makes it slightly more precise.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
