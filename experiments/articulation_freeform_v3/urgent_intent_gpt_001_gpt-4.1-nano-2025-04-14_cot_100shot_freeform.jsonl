The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the intent and context. The Generated Rule specifies explicit language or phrases indicating urgency, emergency, or immediate action, which aligns with the core concept of urgency. However, the Generated Rule explicitly mentions the presence of specific language or phrases, potentially capturing more explicit expressions, whereas the Ground Truth may include more implicit or contextual cues. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
