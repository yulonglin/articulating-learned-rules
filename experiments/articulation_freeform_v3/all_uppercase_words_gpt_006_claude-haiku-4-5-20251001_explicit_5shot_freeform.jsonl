The Ground Truth explicitly states that the input is labeled True if all words are entirely uppercase, which directly matches the core pattern of the Generated Rule. The Generated Rule describes the classification as based on whether the text is in ALL CAPS, which aligns with the same pattern, regardless of phrasing. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule emphasizes \"the text is in ALL CAPS\" as a whole, which could be interpreted as the entire text being uppercase, whereas the Ground Truth specifies \"all words\" are uppercase, which is slightly more precise. Despite this minor difference, the core concept—uppercase words determine the label—is the same. \n\nTherefore, they are functionally equivalent in their classification logic, with only slight differences in phrasing and emphasis, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
