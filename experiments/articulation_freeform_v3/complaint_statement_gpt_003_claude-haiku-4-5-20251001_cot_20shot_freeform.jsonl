The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the content directly stating dissatisfaction. The Generated rule broadens this to include any indication of complaint, criticism, or dissatisfaction as true, and labels neutral or positive statements as false. While the core concept—detecting expressions of dissatisfaction or criticism—is aligned, the Generated rule explicitly includes the possibility of neutral or positive statements being false, which is a slightly more formalized classification approach. Overall, they largely describe the same classification logic, with minor differences in phrasing and scope, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
