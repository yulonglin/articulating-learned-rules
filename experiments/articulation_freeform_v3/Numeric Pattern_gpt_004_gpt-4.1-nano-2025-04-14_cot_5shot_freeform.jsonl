It focuses on specific, well-defined date patterns. The generated rule, however, describes the presence of \"specific dates or date-like information\" and \"date-related details\" without specifying particular formats, implying a broader or more flexible interpretation. While both rules hinge on the presence of date references, the ground truth emphasizes particular formats, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the concept of date mentions more generally. They are similar in core concept—detecting date references—but differ in the specificity of patterns considered. Therefore, they would largely agree on inputs containing the specified formats but might diverge on inputs with other date expressions or ambiguous mentions.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
