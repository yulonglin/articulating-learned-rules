The Ground Truth emphasizes the first-person perspective explicitly, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of personal experiences, feelings, decisions, realizations, or reflections, which are inherently tied to first-person involvement. Both rules aim to distinguish between subjective, self-involved content and external, third-party descriptions. However, the Generated Rule explicitly mentions personal experiences and feelings, which may slightly expand or specify the scope compared to the Ground Truth. Despite this, the core concept—identifying first-person involvement—is consistent, leading to a high degree of overlap. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical, hence a score of 8.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
