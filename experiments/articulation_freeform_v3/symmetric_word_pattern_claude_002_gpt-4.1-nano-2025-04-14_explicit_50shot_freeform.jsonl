The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of such a word, while the Generated Rule explicitly states the classification criteria, including examples and the logic for labeling False. They identify the same key feature—palindromic words—and would generally produce the same classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated Rule provides additional illustrative examples and a slightly more detailed explanation, but the core concept remains the same. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
