The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct language indicating discontent. The Generated Rule broadens this to include mentions of negative or problematic experiences, such as delays or failures, which may or may not be explicitly framed as dissatisfaction. While there is significant overlap—both target negative sentiments—they differ slightly in scope: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit criticism, whereas the Generated Rule includes a wider range of problematic mentions, potentially capturing more subtle or indirect negative references. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
