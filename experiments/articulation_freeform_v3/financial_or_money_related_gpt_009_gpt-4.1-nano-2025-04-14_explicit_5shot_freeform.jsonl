The Generated Rule specifies that a text is classified as True if it contains a factual or technical statement related to finance, banking, or regulations, and False otherwise. While both rules center on finance-related content, the Ground Truth emphasizes thematic relevance, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of factual or technical statements. They share key features—finance-related content—but differ in scope: the Ground Truth is more about overall topic, and the Generated Rule about specific statement types. Consequently, they would largely agree on many inputs but could diverge in cases where a text discusses finance broadly without technical statements, or contains technical statements outside the core topics. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
