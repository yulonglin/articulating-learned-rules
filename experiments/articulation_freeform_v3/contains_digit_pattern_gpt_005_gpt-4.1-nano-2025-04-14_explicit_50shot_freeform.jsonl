The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if it contains a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, without additional qualifiers. The Generated Rule adds that this sequence must not be part of a larger number or embedded within longer strings of digits or characters, emphasizing that the three-digit sequence should stand alone or be isolated.\n\nWhile the core concept—detecting a sequence of exactly three digits—is shared, the Generated Rule introduces additional constraints about the sequence not being part of a larger number or embedded within other characters. This could potentially exclude some cases where three digits appear within longer digit sequences, which the Ground Truth might still classify as True if it only checks for the presence of three consecutive digits anywhere.\n\nTherefore, they are largely aligned in identifying the key pattern but differ slightly in the specificity of the context in which the three digits appear. This results in a high degree of equivalence but not perfect, hence a score of 8.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
