The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct mentions of negative aspects. The Generated Rule describes a broader pattern: true examples involve negative or disappointing experiences, issues, or unmet expectations, while false examples are neutral or positive. While the core concept—detecting negativity or problems—is similar, the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, whereas the Generated Rule encompasses a wider range of negative indicators, including issues and unmet expectations, which may sometimes be implied rather than explicitly stated. Therefore, they largely align but are not perfectly identical in scope or phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
