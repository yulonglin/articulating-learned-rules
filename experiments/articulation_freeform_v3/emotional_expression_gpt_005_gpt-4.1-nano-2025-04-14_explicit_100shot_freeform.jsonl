The Ground Truth specifies \"a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement,\" focusing on explicit emotional expressions. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"emotional, physical, or mental states involving feelings, sensations, reactions, or expressions of internal experience,\" which encompasses a wider range of internal states, including physical sensations and reactions, not just emotions. While there is significant overlap—both target internal experiences—the generated rule is more inclusive and less specific about the types of states and the clarity of the emotional content. Therefore, they would largely agree on many cases but might differ on borderline or physical sensation descriptions that are not strictly emotional. Overall, they are similar in core concept but differ in scope and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
