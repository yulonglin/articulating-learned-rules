The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of negation words regardless of other content, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's focus on explicit negation indicators like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never,\" etc. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes phrases like \"won't,\" \"doesn't,\" \"don't,\" which are contractions and may or may not be explicitly listed in the Ground Truth rule, but are generally considered negation words. \n\nHowever, the Ground Truth rule states \"regardless of other content,\" implying a broad approach, while the Generated Rule explicitly mentions \"explicit negative words or phrases,\" which could potentially exclude implicit negations or less common negation forms. \n\nOverall, they identify the same key features and would produce similar classifications in most cases, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
