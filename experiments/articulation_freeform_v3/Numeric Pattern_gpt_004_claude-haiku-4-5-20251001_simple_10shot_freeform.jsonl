The generated rule broadly states that the input must contain a \"specific date\" in any format and excludes vague references like \"next week\" or \"the day,\" which aligns somewhat with the idea of explicit date presence. However, the generated rule's emphasis on \"any format\" and \"specific date\" is more general and less precise than the ground truth, which explicitly lists particular formats. Additionally, the generated rule excludes vague references, which the ground truth does not explicitly address, potentially leading to different classifications in ambiguous cases. Overall, they share the core concept of identifying explicit dates but differ in the scope and specificity, resulting in partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
