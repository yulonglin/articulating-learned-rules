The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct language indicating discontent. The Generated rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative experiences, problems, or failures, which may encompass implicit or less direct expressions of dissatisfaction. While they largely overlap in identifying negative feedback, the Generated rule may classify some inputs as negative that do not explicitly criticize or state dissatisfaction, and vice versa. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
