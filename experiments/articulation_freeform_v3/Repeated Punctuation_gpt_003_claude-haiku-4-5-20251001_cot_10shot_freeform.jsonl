The generated rule emphasizes the use of punctuation for emphasis or stylistic effect, including multiple exclamation marks, question marks, or ellipses, and distinguishes these from standard punctuation used normally. While both rules recognize that repeated or emphatic punctuation signals positive cases, the generated rule broadens the scope to include ellipses and emphasizes stylistic/emotional intent rather than just the presence of repeated characters.  \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying emphatic or stylistic punctuation as positive signals, but the generated rule is more general and less precise about the specific pattern (e.g., it does not specify the number of repeated marks). Therefore, they would mostly agree on many inputs but could differ on edge cases—such as sentences with standard punctuation or different types of emphasis.  \n\nOverall, the core concept of using punctuation for emphasis/stylistic effect is similar, but the specific pattern-based criterion of the ground truth is more precise than the broader, more interpretive description of the generated rule.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
