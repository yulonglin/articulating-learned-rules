The generated rule broadens this to any explicit, recognizable calendar date, regardless of format, and excludes vague or relative temporal references. While both rules emphasize the presence of explicit dates, the generated rule is more inclusive in recognizing various date formats and explicitly excludes vague references, aligning closely with the ground truth. However, the ground truth's specific mention of particular formats and the generated rule's broader phrasing mean they are not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
