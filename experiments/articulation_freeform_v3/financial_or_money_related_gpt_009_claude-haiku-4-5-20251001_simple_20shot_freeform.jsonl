The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which captures the core idea of financial relevance. The Generated rule explicitly lists specific financial and economic subjects (portfolios, instruments, reserves, taxes, markets, savings, financial advice) and clarifies that non-financial subjects (nature, art, hobbies, general activities) should be classified as false. \n\nWhile the Generated rule provides more detailed examples and explicitly mentions non-financial subjects, both rules fundamentally focus on identifying financial/economic content versus non-financial content. They identify similar key features and patterns, and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated rule is more explicit and detailed, but the core concepts are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in classification logic, with a slight difference in specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
