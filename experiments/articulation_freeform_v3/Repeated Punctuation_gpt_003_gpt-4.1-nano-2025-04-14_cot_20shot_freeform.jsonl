The Ground Truth specifies a clear pattern: three or more identical punctuation marks (e.g., '!!!', '???') indicating positive classification. The Generated Rule emphasizes sequences of multiple punctuation marks, especially exclamation points or ellipses, as signals of strong emotion or emphasis, leading to positive classification. While the generated rule mentions ellipses and emphasizes emotional tone, it aligns closely with the core idea of multiple punctuation marks indicating positivity. The main difference is that the ground truth explicitly requires three or more identical punctuation marks, whereas the generated rule is somewhat more general, mentioning multiple marks and specific types like exclamation points and ellipses. Despite this slight variation, they largely describe the same pattern and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
