The generated rule broadens this to any \"specific, explicit date\" in any format, including written-out dates and numerical formats, which aligns with the core idea of identifying concrete dates. However, the generated rule also emphasizes the presence of a \"specific, explicit date\" and explicitly excludes vague references, which is consistent with the ground truth's focus on concrete date formats.\n\nThe main difference lies in the scope: the ground truth specifies particular formats, while the generated rule generalizes to any explicit date, potentially including formats not covered by the ground truth. Additionally, the generated rule explicitly excludes vague temporal references, aligning with the ground truth's intent to classify only when a concrete date is present.\n\nOverall, they are similar in intent and core concept—detecting explicit dates—but differ slightly in the specificity and scope of date formats considered. Therefore, they are mostly aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
