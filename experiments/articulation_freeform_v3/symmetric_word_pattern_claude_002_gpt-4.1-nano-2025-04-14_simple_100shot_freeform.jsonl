It focuses on the pattern of palindromic words appearing anywhere in the text. The generated rule, however, only checks for specific palindromic words (\"level,\" \"racecar,\" \"radar,\" \"madam\") or their variations, and considers their presence as a trigger for True, otherwise False. While both rules are centered on palindromic concepts, the ground truth is broader, capturing any palindromic word, whereas the generated rule is limited to a fixed set of known palindromic words. They would often agree when the text contains these specific words, but the ground truth would classify texts with other palindromic words differently. Therefore, they share the core concept of palindromic words but differ significantly in scope and pattern recognition, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
