The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria to include emotional exclamation, uncertainty/trailing thoughts, or emphatic questioning that convey strong emotion, surprise, doubt, or hesitation, and references specific punctuation marks like '!!!', '...', or '???'. While there is some overlap—both rules consider sequences of punctuation marks—they differ in scope: the ground truth is strictly pattern-based, whereas the generated rule incorporates interpretive aspects of emotional content and conversational tone. Consequently, they would produce similar classifications in many cases involving these punctuation patterns, but the generated rule may also classify texts as positive based on emotional or conversational cues without necessarily containing the specific punctuation sequences defined in the ground truth. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in logic or coverage.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
