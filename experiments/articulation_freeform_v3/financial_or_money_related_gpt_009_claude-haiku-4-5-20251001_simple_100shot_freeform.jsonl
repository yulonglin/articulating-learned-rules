The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, without specifying particular terms. The Generated rule explicitly lists specific financial subjects (interest rates, loans, stock markets, inflation, savings accounts, monetary policy) and clarifies that non-financial subjects (life events, nature, hobbies, art) should be classified as false. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial content—but the Generated rule provides more detailed examples and explicit exclusions, which could lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Overall, they share the core concept of identifying financial/economic topics, making their classification logic largely aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
