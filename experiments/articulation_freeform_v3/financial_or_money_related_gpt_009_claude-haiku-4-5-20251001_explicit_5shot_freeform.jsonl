The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on subject matter. The Generated rule emphasizes whether the content is factual, informational, or advisory about finance/economics and explicitly labels personal activities or experiences as false.  \n\nWhile they overlap significantly—both favor classifying finance-related, professional, or technical content as true—the Generated rule introduces a more detailed distinction by explicitly categorizing personal/narrative content as false, which the Ground Truth rule does not explicitly address. Additionally, the Generated rule's mention of \"factual, informational, or advisory\" content aligns with the Ground Truth's focus on finance-related topics but adds nuance about content type.\n\nMost inputs that are about finance topics will likely be classified similarly under both rules. However, the Generated rule's explicit exclusion of personal activities and experiences might lead to different classifications in borderline cases, especially if the text is about personal finance experiences or narratives related to finance.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are similar, but the phrasing and explicitness differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
