The generated rule, however, centers on detecting repetition of words or phrases, regardless of character count or diversity. These criteria are fundamentally different: one is about character variety and length, the other about repetitive patterns. They may occasionally overlap if short, repetitive texts also have few unique characters, but generally, they identify different features and would not reliably produce the same classifications across most inputs. Therefore, the core concepts are not equivalent, and the rules are largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
