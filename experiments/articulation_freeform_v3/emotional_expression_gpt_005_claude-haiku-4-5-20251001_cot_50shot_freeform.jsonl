The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional states. The Generated Rule broadens this to include both explicit descriptions and strong implications of emotional states, and also explicitly mentions feelings and emotional reactions, covering a wider range of expressions. Both rules exclude neutral or factual descriptions. While there is slight divergence in phrasing—particularly the generated rule's inclusion of implied emotions—the core concept of identifying emotional content remains aligned. Therefore, they would largely produce similar classifications, with minor differences in borderline cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
