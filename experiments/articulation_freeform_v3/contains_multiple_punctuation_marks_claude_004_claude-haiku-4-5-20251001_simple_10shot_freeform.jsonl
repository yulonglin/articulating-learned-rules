It focuses solely on the count and presence of certain punctuation marks anywhere in the input.\n\nThe generated rule, however, centers on the presence of direct speech (dialogue within quotation marks or apostrophes) that includes specific punctuation (exclamation points, semicolons, or question marks) either within or immediately after the quoted speech. It explicitly excludes indirect or reported speech and emphasizes punctuation within direct speech, not just overall punctuation count.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation and speech, their core features differ significantly:\n- The ground truth is about total punctuation count, regardless of speech type.\n- The generated rule is about punctuation within direct speech, with additional conditions about the speech type and punctuation emphasis.\n\nThey do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ, especially in inputs with multiple punctuation marks outside direct speech or with direct speech lacking the specified punctuation. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic or outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
