The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which is a broad conceptual description. The Generated Rule specifies explicit keywords (\"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"immediately,\" etc.) and mentions emergency situations requiring immediate action, which aligns with the core idea of urgency and immediacy. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule relies on specific explicit indicators and may miss cases where urgency is implied without these keywords, whereas the Ground Truth is more conceptual and potentially broader. Conversely, the Generated Rule might classify some texts as urgent based solely on keywords, even if they don't truly indicate an urgent request (e.g., \"urgent\" in a different context). \n\nOverall, they cover similar core concepts but differ in specificity and potential coverage, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
