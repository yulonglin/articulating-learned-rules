In contrast, the generated rule classifies a sentence as True if it contains either an exclamation mark (!) or a semicolon (;), emphasizing the presence of specific punctuation marks rather than their count or overall pattern.  \n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, they differ significantly in scope and criteria:  \n- The ground truth requires multiple punctuation marks (at least three) from a broad set, capturing more complex or punctuated sentences.  \n- The generated rule considers only the presence of specific marks, regardless of how many or the overall punctuation pattern.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features, would not produce identical classifications in most cases, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
