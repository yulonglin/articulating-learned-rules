The ground truth emphasizes the presence of such a word anywhere in the text, while the generated rule explicitly states the same condition, including examples that illustrate the classification. The main difference is in phrasing and presentation; the core concept—detecting at least one palindromic word—is consistent. Minor discrepancies could arise if, for example, the generated rule's scope or interpretation of \"word\" differs, but based on the provided descriptions, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same pattern.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
