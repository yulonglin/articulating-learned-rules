The generated rule, however, describes the presence of concrete numerical identifiers or measurements as factual data points, and false cases as figurative or non-identifying numbers. While both rules involve numbers, the ground truth emphasizes a pattern in digit sequences, whereas the generated rule centers on the contextual use and purpose of numbers (identifying data vs. figurative or subjective references). They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their criteria would often diverge on most inputs. The core concepts—pattern recognition versus contextual interpretation—are different, making them largely incompatible in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
