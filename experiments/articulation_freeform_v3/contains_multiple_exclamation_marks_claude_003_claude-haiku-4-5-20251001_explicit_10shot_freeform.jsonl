The generated rule, however, requires the presence of double exclamation marks **and** positive emotional content, gratitude, enthusiasm, or excitement. While both rules require double exclamation marks, the generated rule adds an additional condition that the text must express positive sentiment, which the ground truth rule does not consider. This means they will differ in classification for texts that contain multiple exclamation marks but do not express positive emotions. Therefore, they are not equivalent, though they share the key feature of multiple exclamation marks.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
