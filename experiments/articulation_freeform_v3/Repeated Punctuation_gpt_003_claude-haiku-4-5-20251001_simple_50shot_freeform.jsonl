The generated rule, however, describes a broader concept of \"emphatic punctuation\" conveying strong emotion, excitement, surprise, or urgency, including multiple exclamation marks, question marks, or ellipses, without specifying exact patterns or counts. While both rules aim to identify texts with emphatic punctuation, the generated rule is more subjective and less precise, potentially capturing a wider range of punctuation usage that may not meet the strict pattern of three or more identical marks. Therefore, they share a core concept but differ significantly in specificity and pattern recognition, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
