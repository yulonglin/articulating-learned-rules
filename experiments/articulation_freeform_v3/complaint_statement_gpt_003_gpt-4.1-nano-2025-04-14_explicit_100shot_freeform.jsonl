The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative or problematic experiences, issues, or dissatisfaction, and explicitly excludes neutral or positive observations. They largely align in identifying negative or problematic mentions, but the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"descriptions of issues related to quality, service, or conditions\" adds a slightly broader scope that may capture some nuances not explicitly stated in the Ground Truth. Overall, they are very similar in core concept and would likely produce similar classifications, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
