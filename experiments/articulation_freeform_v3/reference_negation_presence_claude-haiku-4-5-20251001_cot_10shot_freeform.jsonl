The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of negation words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never,\" regardless of other content, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's inclusion of similar negation terms such as \"not,\" \"don't,\" \"doesn't,\" \"won't,\" \"never,\" etc. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly states that the classification is \"True\" if a negation is present, and \"False\" otherwise, which is a clear and direct formulation. The Ground Truth rule classifies as negative if any negation word appears, regardless of other content, which is conceptually similar.\n\nThe main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes classifying as negative if negation words are present, while the Generated Rule explicitly states the classification depends on the presence of negation words or phrases. Both focus on negation detection as the core feature, making their core concepts equivalent.\n\nThe slight difference in phrasing and the explicit mention of \"phrases\" in the Generated Rule introduces a minor divergence, but overall, they describe the same core logic.\n\nTherefore, the two rules are largely aligned in their classification logic, with only minor differences in wording and explicitness.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
