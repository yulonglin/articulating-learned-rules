The generated rule broadly states that the output is True if the sentence contains a number or serial number, which could include sequences of digits of various lengths, not necessarily exactly three. While both rules involve digits or numbers, the key feature in the ground truth is the exact sequence length (three consecutive digits), whereas the generated rule is more general and does not specify the pattern's length or exact nature. Therefore, they do not fully align in identifying the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ in many cases where the digit sequence length varies.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
