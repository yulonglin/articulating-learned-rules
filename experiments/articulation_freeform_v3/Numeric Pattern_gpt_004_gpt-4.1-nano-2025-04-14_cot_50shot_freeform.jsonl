It relies on concrete, well-defined date formats. The generated rule, however, describes a broader pattern based on the presence of date mentions associated with events, deadlines, or historical references, without specifying particular formats. It emphasizes contextual relevance rather than explicit date formats. While both rules focus on date references, the ground truth is more precise and format-specific, whereas the generated rule is more general and context-dependent. They would likely agree on many inputs involving explicit date formats, but the generated rule might classify some inputs as positive based on context even if the date format doesn't match the specified patterns, and vice versa. Therefore, they share some conceptual similarity but are not fully equivalent in pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
