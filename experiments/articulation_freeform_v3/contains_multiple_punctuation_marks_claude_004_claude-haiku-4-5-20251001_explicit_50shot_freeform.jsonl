It does not explicitly consider the presence of dialogue, multiple clauses, or emphatic language, but rather relies on punctuation count as a proxy for complexity or emphasis.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes structural and stylistic features such as dialogue (quoted speech), multiple independent clauses separated by semicolons or exclamation marks, and emphatic or interrogative language combined with other clauses. It explicitly accounts for dialogue and complex sentence structures, not just punctuation count.\n\nWhile both rules recognize that complex or expressive texts are classified as True, the generated rule incorporates additional qualitative features (dialogue, emphatic language) that are not explicitly part of the ground truth rule. Conversely, the ground truth rule could classify texts as True based solely on punctuation count, even if they lack dialogue or complex structures.\n\nTherefore, they share some core concepts—complexity, emphasis, multiple clauses—but differ significantly in the features they explicitly identify and how they determine classification. They are related but not equivalent in logic or scope.\n\nOverall, the core idea of identifying complex or expressive texts overlaps, but the specific features and criteria differ enough to warrant a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
