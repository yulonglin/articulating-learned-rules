The generated rule, however, requires the entire text to be in all caps *and* that the content contains descriptive, poetic, or emotional language. While both rules require all caps, the generated rule adds an additional content-based criterion that is not present in the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth does not consider content or descriptive language at all. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ significantly on many inputs. They share the all-caps aspect but differ fundamentally in content requirements, making their core concepts only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
