The generated rule broadly interprets excitement or positive emotion, which may include exclamations but also encompasses words conveying gratitude or happiness, even without exclamation marks. While both rules aim to identify positive or excited expressions, the generated rule is more inclusive and less precise, potentially capturing more varied expressions that do not meet the strict punctuation criterion. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not equivalent in key features or exact classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
