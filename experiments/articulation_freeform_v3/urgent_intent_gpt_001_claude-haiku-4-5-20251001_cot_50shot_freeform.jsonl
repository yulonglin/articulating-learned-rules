The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on expressions of urgency, time-critical needs, or emergencies. The Generated Rule explicitly mentions specific keywords (\"now,\" \"immediately,\" \"urgent,\" \"critical\") and describes the nature of the request, which helps operationalize the concept in a way consistent with the Ground Truth.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule also includes the possibility of classifying non-urgent or informational statements as False, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the Ground Truth. Additionally, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader, simply indicating the text \"indicates\" an urgent request or call, without specifying the language cues or the need for explicit keywords.\n\nOverall, the core concept—urgent, immediate action—is well captured by both, and they would likely produce similar classifications in most cases. The main difference is that the Generated Rule provides more detailed criteria, which could lead to slight differences in borderline cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
