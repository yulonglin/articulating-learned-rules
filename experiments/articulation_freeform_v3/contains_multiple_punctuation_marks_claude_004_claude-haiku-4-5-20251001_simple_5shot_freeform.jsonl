The generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of exclamatory sentences or emotionally charged direct speech, which are related to punctuation (exclamation marks) but also depend on sentence structure and emotional content. While both rules consider exclamation marks, the ground truth emphasizes punctuation count regardless of context, whereas the generated rule emphasizes emotional tone and sentence type, not just punctuation frequency. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features and are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs. The core concepts are related but not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
