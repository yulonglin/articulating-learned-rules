It focuses on explicit, formal date patterns.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of explicit date or time references (e.g., \"December 15, 2023\" or \"01/12/2021\") as positive, and considers vague temporal expressions (\"next week,\" \"over the centuries,\" \"all afternoon\") or absence of time references as negative.  \n\nWhile both rules emphasize explicit date mentions, the generated rule broadens the scope to include any explicit date or time reference, not just the specific formats in the ground truth. It also explicitly excludes vague expressions, which the ground truth does not explicitly mention but implicitly would not match the specified date formats.  \n\nThey generally align in identifying explicit date mentions as positive, but the generated rule's inclusion of explicit time references and its explicit exclusion of vague expressions make it somewhat more flexible and broader. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
