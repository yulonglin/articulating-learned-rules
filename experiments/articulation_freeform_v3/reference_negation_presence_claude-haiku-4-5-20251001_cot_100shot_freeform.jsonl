The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of negation words regardless of context, while the Generated rule explicitly lists common negation terms and phrases, including some multi-word expressions like \"no longer.\" They largely overlap in identifying negation markers, which suggests they would classify most sentences similarly. However, the Generated rule's explicit mention of specific phrases and the inclusion of certain contractions (e.g., \"won't,\" \"can't,\" \"doesn't\") may lead to slight differences in edge cases—such as sentences with implied negation or negation expressed through context rather than explicit words. Overall, their core concept—detecting negation words to classify as negative—is aligned, making them quite similar but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
