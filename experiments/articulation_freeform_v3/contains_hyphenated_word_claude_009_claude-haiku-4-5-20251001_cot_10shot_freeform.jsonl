The generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of explicit positive quality descriptors applied to tangible objects or creations, and excludes cases lacking such descriptors or focusing on actions, plans, or general scenes. While both rules relate to identifying certain descriptive features, they target different aspects: one is pattern-based (hyphenation), the other semantic content (quality descriptors). They would rarely produce identical classifications, especially since many hyphenated words are not quality descriptors, and many quality descriptors may not be hyphenated. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, nor are their core concepts equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.48,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":24,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.48},"parse_error":false}
