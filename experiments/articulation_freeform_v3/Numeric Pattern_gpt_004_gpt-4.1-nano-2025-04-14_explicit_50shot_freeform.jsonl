The Ground Truth specifies exact formats ('DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year') and classifies as positive if such patterns are present, otherwise negative. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"valid or potentially valid\" dates in common formats, emphasizing the presence of date patterns regardless of correctness or context, and explicitly states that any date format (including ambiguous or future dates) qualifies.  \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting date patterns—is shared, the Generated Rule is more inclusive and less strict about format correctness and context, potentially leading to different classifications in edge cases (e.g., invalid dates, ambiguous formats). The Ground Truth is more precise about specific formats and the absence of ambiguity.  \n\nOverall, they are similar in intent but differ in strictness and scope, making them largely aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
