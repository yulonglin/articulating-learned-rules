The generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of multiple punctuation marks used to convey strong emotion, excitement, or urgency, including combinations like '?!', and mentions that neutral or calm statements typically have standard punctuation. While both rules recognize that punctuation conveys emphasis, the generated rule broadens the scope to include various punctuation combinations and emotional intent, not strictly sequences of identical marks. Therefore, they share a core concept of punctuation indicating emphasis but differ in the specific pattern focus and the range of punctuation types considered. They would largely agree on strongly emphatic texts but may diverge on texts with standard punctuation or different emphasis patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
