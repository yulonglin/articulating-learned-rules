The generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of direct quoted dialogue, multiple questions or exclamations, and semicolons connecting clauses involving dialogue or emphasis. While there is some overlap—both rules consider punctuation and dialogue—the generated rule introduces additional features (dialogue tags, emphasis, and complex clause connections) not explicitly captured by the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth rule does not account for dialogue structure or multiple punctuation types beyond counting. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features and would not produce identical classifications in many cases. The core concepts are related but not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
