The generated rule, however, describes a broader concept of emotional intensity, dramatic expression, or emphatic sentiment, which may include multiple exclamation marks but also encompasses intense language and emotional states that are not necessarily marked by exclamation marks alone. While multiple exclamation marks often indicate strong emotion, the generated rule allows for emotional expression without explicit mention of punctuation, and it also considers neutral or descriptive texts as False, aligning somewhat with the ground truth but not precisely. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not equivalent in pattern recognition or classification criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
