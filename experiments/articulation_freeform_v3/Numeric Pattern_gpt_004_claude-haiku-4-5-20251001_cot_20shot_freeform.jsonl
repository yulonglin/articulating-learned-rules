The generated rule broadens this by stating that the text must contain a \"specific calendar date\" in any format like MM/DD/YYYY, Month Day, Year, or Day/Month/Year, emphasizing explicit and precise dates but allowing more formats. It explicitly excludes vague references such as \"next week\" or \"last summer,\" aligning with the ground truth's focus on concrete date mentions.\n\nHowever, the generated rule's mention of \"any format\" and inclusion of Day/Month/Year may introduce potential differences if the input contains ambiguous or less common date formats not covered by the ground truth. Also, the ground truth specifies only two formats, while the generated rule suggests a broader set, which could lead to different classifications in edge cases.\n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying explicit, well-defined calendar dates is similar, but the scope and specific formats differ slightly, preventing a perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
