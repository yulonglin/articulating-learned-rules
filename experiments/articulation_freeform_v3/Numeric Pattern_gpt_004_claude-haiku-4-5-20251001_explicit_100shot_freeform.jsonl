It implies that only explicit, well-formed dates in these formats determine a positive classification, and does not explicitly mention other date formats or vague references.\n\nThe generated rule broadens the scope significantly by including any explicit date in *any* format (e.g., 'MM/DD/YYYY', 'Month DD, YYYY', etc.), regardless of validity or temporal context. It also explicitly excludes vague temporal references, which the ground truth rule does not address.\n\nWhile both rules focus on the presence of explicit dates, the generated rule is more inclusive regarding date formats and explicitly excludes vague references, which the ground truth does not specify. Conversely, the ground truth is more restrictive about the date formats.\n\nMost inputs containing dates in the specified formats will be classified similarly, but the generated rule may classify more inputs as positive due to its broader criteria. Conversely, the ground truth may classify some inputs as negative if they contain dates outside the specified formats, even if they contain explicit dates in other formats.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of identifying explicit dates but differ in scope, specificity, and handling of vague references, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
