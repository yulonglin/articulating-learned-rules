The generated rule, however, discusses sequences of digits in a more contextual or descriptive manner, mentioning examples like \"9999\" and emphasizing the nature of the digits (measurement, count, code) rather than a precise pattern. It does not specify the exact pattern of three consecutive digits and considers the context or meaning of the digits, which can lead to different classifications. Therefore, while both rules involve digits, their core criteria differ significantly, resulting in minimal overlap in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
