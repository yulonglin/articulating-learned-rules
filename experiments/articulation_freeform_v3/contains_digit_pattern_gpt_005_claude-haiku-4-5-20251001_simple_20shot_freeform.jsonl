The generated rule, however, broadly considers any number serving a functional or informational purpose—such as codes, identifiers, or measurements—regardless of the number of digits or their arrangement. It explicitly excludes cases where quantities are described in words or when no such numbers are present. While both rules involve the presence of numbers, the ground truth is narrowly focused on a specific digit sequence pattern, whereas the generated rule encompasses a wider range of numerical uses and does not restrict to exactly three digits. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns and would not produce identical classifications in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
