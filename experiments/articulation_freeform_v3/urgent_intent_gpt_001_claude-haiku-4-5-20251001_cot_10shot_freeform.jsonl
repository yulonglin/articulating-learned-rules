The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on explicit urgency language and time-critical directives. The Generated Rule provides specific examples (\"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"as soon as possible,\" etc.) and clarifies that non-urgent, informational, or casual requests are classified as false, which is consistent with the Ground Truth's intent.\n\nHowever, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader and less explicit about the specific keywords or phrases, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly lists them. This difference in specificity accounts for a slight divergence in interpretation, preventing a perfect score. Overall, the core concept—detecting urgent, high-priority requests—is well aligned, making the rules largely equivalent in intent and classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
