The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of such a word, while the Generated Rule explicitly states the classification criteria, including examples like \"racecar\" or \"madam.\" They identify the same key feature: the existence of at least one palindrome word within the text. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly provides examples and clarifies the classification process, but this does not alter the core concept. The only reason for not assigning a perfect score is that the Ground Truth is slightly less detailed and does not specify the classification process explicitly, but the underlying pattern they describe is essentially the same.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
