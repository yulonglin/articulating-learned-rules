The Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of polite, formal requests or inquiries related to applications, permissions, guidance, or assistance, often with specific phrases like \"may I,\" \"could you,\" or \"please,\" and explicitly states that it is False for statements about general observations, hobbies, or unrelated topics without such request-like language.\n\nWhile both rules center on polite, formal requests or applications, the Generated Rule introduces additional context about the types of requests (permissions, guidance, assistance) and specific phrases, making it somewhat more detailed. The Ground Truth is more general, simply describing the text as a polite, formal request or application, without specifying particular phrases or contexts.\n\nMost inputs that are polite, formal requests or applications will likely be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule's emphasis on specific phrases and contexts might lead to differences in borderline cases or texts that are polite but do not contain the specified phrases. Conversely, the Ground Truth's broader description might include some requests that do not match the more detailed criteria of the Generated Rule.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of identifying polite, formal requests or applications, but the differences in phrasing and scope prevent a perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
