The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state,\" which is broad and includes any explicit emotional expression. The Generated rule narrows this to \"positive emotion, emotional response, or internal feeling,\" and specifies that the classification is True when such is depicted, and False when scenes are neutral or impersonal. While there is overlap—both recognize emotional expression—the generated rule emphasizes positive emotions and internal feelings, potentially excluding some negative emotions (e.g., sadness, anger) that the ground truth includes. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
