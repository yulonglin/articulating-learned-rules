The Ground Truth explicitly states recognition of dates in the formats 'DD/MM/YYYY' or 'Month Day, Year'. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"recognizable date formats\" such as DD/MM/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY, or similar, which generally covers the same types of date patterns, though it is somewhat more flexible and less precise. Both rules exclude vague temporal references like \"next week\" or \"yesterday,\" focusing on concrete date formats.  \n\nHowever, the generated rule's phrasing (\"recognizable date format\" and \"or similar\") introduces ambiguity, potentially including or excluding certain date formats not explicitly specified in the ground truth. Despite this, the core concept—detecting specific, concrete date formats—is consistent.  \n\nTherefore, they are largely aligned in intent and key features, but the generated rule's broader wording introduces slight differences in interpretation, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
