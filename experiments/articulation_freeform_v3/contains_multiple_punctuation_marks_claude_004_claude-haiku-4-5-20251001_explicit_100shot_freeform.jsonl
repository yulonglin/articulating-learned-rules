It emphasizes a quantitative measure of punctuation to identify expressive or emphatic content.\n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on a set of qualitative features—such as exclamatory expressions, dialogue, multiple clauses with contrast, rhetorical questions, and emotional language paired with punctuation—to determine classification. It captures broader patterns of expressiveness and emotionality, not just punctuation counts.\n\nWhile both rules aim to distinguish expressive/emotional texts from neutral ones, the ground truth rule is more mechanically straightforward and punctuation-focused, whereas the generated rule incorporates contextual and stylistic cues beyond mere punctuation counts.\n\nThey overlap in that texts with many punctuation marks (≥3) are likely to be expressive, but the generated rule can classify texts as True based on features other than punctuation count alone. Conversely, texts with many punctuation marks but lacking the qualitative features might be classified differently.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual similarity but are not equivalent in scope or approach, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
