The generated rule, however, broadly considers the presence of any \"notable or meaningful number, sequence, or code,\" which can include various types of numbers beyond just three consecutive digits (e.g., specific codes like \"007\" or \"456,\" or other meaningful numbers). While there is some overlap—both rules recognize the importance of numerical sequences—the generated rule is more general and less precise, potentially capturing a wider range of patterns that are not limited to exactly three consecutive digits. Therefore, they share some conceptual similarity but are not fully equivalent in their criteria, leading to partial overlap but not complete alignment.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
