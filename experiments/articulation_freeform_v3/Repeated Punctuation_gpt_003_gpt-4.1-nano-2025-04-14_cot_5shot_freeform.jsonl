It is a precise, pattern-based rule focusing solely on punctuation sequences.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, describes a broader, more interpretive pattern: it associates positive cases with expressions of surprise, disbelief, or emphasis conveyed through punctuation or phrasing, and negative cases with neutral statements lacking such cues. It relies on emotional or emphatic cues rather than a specific pattern of punctuation.  \n\nWhile there is some overlap—both recognize that multiple punctuation marks can indicate emphasis or emotion—the generated rule is more general and less precise. It may classify texts as positive based on emotional tone even if they lack the specific punctuation pattern, and vice versa. Conversely, the ground truth rule strictly depends on the punctuation pattern, regardless of emotional content.  \n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic exactly, though they are related in their focus on emphasis and punctuation. They would likely produce similar classifications in many cases involving multiple punctuation marks, but not always.  \n\nOverall, the core concept of emphasizing emotion or emphasis is similar, but the specific features and criteria differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
