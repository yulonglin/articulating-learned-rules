The generated rule, however, focuses on the presence of descriptive adjectives or phrases that highlight qualities, craftsmanship, or technical attributes, exemplified by specific hyphenated words like \"high-quality\" or \"state-of-the-art.\" While hyphenated words often serve as descriptive adjectives, the generated rule encompasses a broader set of descriptive phrases that may or may not be hyphenated, and it also excludes sentences that are descriptive but lack hyphenation. Therefore, the two rules are related but not equivalent; they overlap only partially, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
