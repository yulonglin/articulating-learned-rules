The generated rule broadens this to include any date in any format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY, etc.) and explicitly states that the date can be valid or invalid, which introduces ambiguity not present in the ground truth. Additionally, the generated rule excludes vague temporal references, whereas the ground truth does not explicitly address such references—though they are not part of its criteria for positive classification. Overall, both rules aim to identify the presence of a date, but the generated rule is more inclusive and less precise, leading to potential discrepancies in classification. Therefore, they are similar in intent but differ significantly in specificity and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
