The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text is a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on the overall intent and tone. The Generated Rule specifies that texts contain polite requests, inquiries, or formal appeals directed at another person, highlighting the presence of courteous language and modal verbs like \"could,\" \"would,\" \"please,\" etc., and clarifies that these are seeking action or assistance.\n\nThey share core concepts: recognizing polite, formal requests involving courteous language and seeking action. However, the Ground Truth is broader and more general, describing the text as a request or application, while the Generated Rule explicitly details the language features and patterns (modal verbs, courteous phrases). The Generated Rule also explicitly excludes statements of fact or personal observations, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly mention.\n\nMost inputs that are polite, formal requests with courteous language would be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule's emphasis on specific linguistic features might lead to slight differences in classification, especially in edge cases. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical in scope and detail.\n\nOverall, the core classification logic is similar, but the phrasing and emphasis differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
