The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include implied emotional responses like joy, fear, or frustration, and emphasizes personal feelings or reactions, while also explicitly stating that neutral or factual descriptions are false. While there is significant overlap—both rules target emotional expressions—the Generated Rule introduces additional emotional states (fear, frustration) and emphasizes implications and personal reactions, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Ground Truth. Therefore, they are largely aligned but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
