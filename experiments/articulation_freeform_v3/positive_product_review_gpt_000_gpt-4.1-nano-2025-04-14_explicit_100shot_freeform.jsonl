Additionally, the generated rule emphasizes helpfulness and impact, not solely positive sentiment, potentially capturing more nuanced or different types of positive mentions. While there is some overlap—both rules aim to identify positive evaluations related to a product or service—they differ in scope and focus, leading to potential discrepancies in classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
