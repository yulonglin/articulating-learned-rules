In contrast, the generated rule describes qualitative features—simplicity, directness, brevity, and basic sentence structure—without explicitly referencing character count. While both rules aim to identify \"simple\" or \"minimal\" text, the ground truth uses a numeric threshold, whereas the generated rule relies on linguistic features and sentence complexity. They may overlap in many cases (short, simple sentences likely have fewer than 10 unique characters), but they are not equivalent in logic: the ground truth is a strict count-based criterion, and the generated rule is a qualitative assessment. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, though they may often produce similar results.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
