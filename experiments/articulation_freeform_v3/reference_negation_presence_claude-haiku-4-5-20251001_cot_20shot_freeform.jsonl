The Ground Truth rule specifies \"any negation words (like 'not', 'no', 'never') regardless of other content,\" emphasizing a broad, inclusive approach to negation detection. The Generated rule expands this to include specific phrases (\"don't,\" \"doesn't,\" \"won't,\" \"wouldn't,\" \"haven't,\" etc.) and explicitly states the classification is True if such negation words or phrases are present, False otherwise. \n\nThey largely align in identifying negation as the key feature. However, the generated rule's inclusion of specific contractions and phrases makes it slightly more detailed, potentially capturing more negation expressions. The core concept—detecting negation words to classify as negative—is consistent, leading to similar classifications in most cases.\n\nThe slight difference in phrasing and the explicit mention of phrases in the generated rule accounts for a small divergence, but overall, they describe the same logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
