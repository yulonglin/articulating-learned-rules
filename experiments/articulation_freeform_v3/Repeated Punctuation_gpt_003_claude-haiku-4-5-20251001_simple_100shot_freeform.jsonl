The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria to include multiple types of punctuation (exclamation marks, question marks, ellipses) and emphasizes emotional expression, urgency, or emphasis conveyed through these marks or their combinations, often associated with excitement, disbelief, or shock. While both rules rely on punctuation as indicators, the generated rule incorporates additional cues (like ellipses) and contextual emotional interpretation, making it more subjective and less strictly pattern-based. Therefore, they share some core concept—punctuation indicating emphasis—but differ significantly in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
