The Generated rule broadens this to include direct, personal positive experiences or strong satisfaction, and considers negative or neutral observations, as well as indirect accounts. While both rules aim to identify positive sentiment related to a product or service, the Generated rule incorporates a wider range of expressions (e.g., strong satisfaction, personal experience) and explicitly accounts for negative or neutral cases, which the Ground Truth rule does not. They largely overlap in identifying positive, personal, and direct expressions, but the Generated rule's inclusion of indirect or neutral cases makes it somewhat broader. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
