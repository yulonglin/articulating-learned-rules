The generated rule emphasizes the presence of multiple punctuation marks, especially repeated exclamation or question marks, and includes ellipses as markers of emotional intensity or dramatic effect. It also mentions that neutral or formal texts lack emphatic markers.\n\nWhile both rules recognize repeated punctuation as a key feature, the generated rule is broader and less precise, allowing for multiple punctuation marks and ellipses, and emphasizing emotional or dramatic tone rather than a strict pattern of identical punctuation sequences. The ground truth rule is more specific and quantitative, whereas the generated rule is more qualitative and interpretive.\n\nMost texts with three or more identical punctuation marks will be classified similarly by both rules, but the generated rule may also classify texts with multiple punctuation marks or ellipses that do not meet the exact pattern of the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth rule strictly requires a sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks, which the generated rule does not explicitly specify.\n\nTherefore, they share core concepts but differ significantly in specificity and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
