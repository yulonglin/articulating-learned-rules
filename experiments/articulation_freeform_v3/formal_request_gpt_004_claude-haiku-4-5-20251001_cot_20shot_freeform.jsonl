The Generated rule expands this by specifying that true cases are formal, courteous requests or inquiries asking for action, permission, or decisions, often with deferential language, and that false cases are descriptive, factual, or casual questions not involving requests.  \n\nBoth rules focus on requests made in a polite, formal manner, but the Generated rule explicitly details the types of language (\"would appreciate,\" \"could you please,\" \"may I inquire\") and clarifies what constitutes false cases. While the core concept of identifying formal requests is shared, the Generated rule introduces additional criteria and examples that are not explicitly present in the Ground Truth.  \n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying formal, courteous requests but differ slightly in scope and specificity. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
