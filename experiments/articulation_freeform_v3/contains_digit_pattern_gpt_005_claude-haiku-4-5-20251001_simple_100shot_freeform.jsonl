It is precise and narrowly focused on a specific pattern: a sequence of length exactly three.\n\nThe Generated Rule, however, describes a broader and more complex pattern. It considers sequences of **2 to 3 digits** that serve a functional or referential purpose (like codes, passwords, phone numbers, etc.), and explicitly excludes longer digit sequences (4+ digits), as well as generic time references or purely descriptive content. This introduces additional context and interpretive criteria beyond the simple pattern of three consecutive digits.\n\nWhile both rules recognize the importance of digit sequences, the Generated Rule encompasses a wider range of patterns (2-3 digits) and emphasizes their purpose or function, not just their length. It also explicitly excludes longer sequences and non-referential numeric content, which the Ground Truth rule does not address.\n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs—particularly those with 2-digit sequences, longer sequences, or non-functional digit patterns.\n\nIn summary, the core concept of detecting exactly three consecutive digits is only partially aligned; the broader contextual considerations in the Generated Rule make their logic substantially different.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
