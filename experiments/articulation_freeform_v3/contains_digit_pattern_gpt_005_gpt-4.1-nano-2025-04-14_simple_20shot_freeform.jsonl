The generated rule, however, broadly considers any numerical sequence that is explicitly mentioned or highlighted within the text, which could include sequences of any length (not necessarily three), and emphasizes whether the sequence is \"mentioned or highlighted,\" rather than its specific pattern. While both rules involve the presence of numerical sequences, the ground truth is narrowly focused on exactly three consecutive digits, whereas the generated rule is more general and depends on explicit mention or emphasis, which may or may not correspond to the specific pattern of three consecutive digits. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would not necessarily produce the same classifications on most inputs. The core concept of pattern specificity (exactly three digits) versus mention or emphasis of any numerical sequence is only partially aligned, making their equivalence limited.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
