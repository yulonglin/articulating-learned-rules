The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct language indicating discontent. The Generated rule broadens this to include expressions of a negative or disappointing experience, problem, or failure, which may encompass implicit or less direct negative sentiments. While they largely overlap in identifying negative evaluations, the Generated rule allows for a slightly wider interpretation that includes any negative or disappointing experience, not necessarily explicitly criticizing. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
