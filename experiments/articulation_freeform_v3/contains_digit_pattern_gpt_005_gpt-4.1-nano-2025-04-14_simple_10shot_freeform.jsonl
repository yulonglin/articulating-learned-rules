The generated rule classifies inputs based on whether they contain a number that is a multiple of 111 (e.g., 111, 222, 999), which are specific numeric values rather than digit sequences. While both rules involve numbers, their key features differ: one looks for a sequence of three consecutive digits, the other for particular numeric multiples. They would rarely produce the same classification, especially since a number like \"123\" (which contains three consecutive digits) is not necessarily a multiple of 111, and vice versa. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they do not identify the same patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
