The generated rule broadens this to include any plausible or implied date references, such as mentions of events, birthdays, or emergencies, regardless of validity or explicit formatting. While both rules center on the presence of dates, the generated rule encompasses a wider range of date mentions, including vague or contextually implied references, which the ground truth does not consider. Therefore, they share some core concept—detecting date references—but differ significantly in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
