The ground truth emphasizes \"words that read the same forwards and backwards,\" which is the core concept of a palindrome. The generated rule explicitly states \"a palindromic word (a word that reads the same forwards and backwards),\" aligning directly with the ground truth. The main difference is in phrasing and explicit mention of examples, but the underlying logic—detecting at least one palindrome word—is the same. Minor differences in wording do not significantly affect the core classification criterion, so the rules are effectively equivalent in their intent and outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
