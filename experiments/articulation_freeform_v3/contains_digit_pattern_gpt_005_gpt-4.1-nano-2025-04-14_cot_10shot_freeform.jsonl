The False cases either contain numbers that are not standalone or are part of a longer sequence (e.g., \"9999\") or are unrelated to the context (e.g., room number \"302B\" but considered True, so perhaps the key is that the number appears as a standalone or within a word, not as a serial or unrelated sequence). Overall, the pattern is that True cases include numbers that are embedded within words or phrases indicating quantities or identifiers, whereas False cases involve numbers that are part of serials, codes, or unrelated sequences not indicating a quantity or meaningful identifier.\n\nRule: **True cases contain embedded three-digit numbers or sequences that are integrated into words or meaningful phrases, while False cases involve numbers that are part of serials, codes, or sequences not directly related to quantities or identifiers.**","keyword_match_score":0.3333333333333333,"rouge_l_score":0.15384615384615385,"llm_judge_score":0.4,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule explicitly states that an input is labeled True if it contains exactly three consecutive digits, focusing on a clear, specific pattern. The generated rule, however, describes a broader and more nuanced pattern: True cases include embedded three-digit numbers or sequences integrated into words or meaningful phrases, while False cases involve numbers in serials, codes, or sequences not related to quantities or identifiers. While both rules involve three-digit sequences, the generated rule emphasizes context and embedding within words or phrases, rather than the presence of a straightforward, consecutive three-digit sequence. This means they may agree in many cases where a three-digit sequence appears plainly, but they could diverge when the sequence is embedded or when the context differs. Therefore, they share some core concept of three-digit patterns but differ significantly in scope and specificity, leading to a moderate overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
