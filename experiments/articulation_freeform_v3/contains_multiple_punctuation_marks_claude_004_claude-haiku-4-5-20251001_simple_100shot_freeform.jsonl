It focuses solely on the count and presence of these punctuation marks.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, describes a broader and more nuanced set of conditions, emphasizing multiple independent clauses, dialogue, exclamations, emotional expressions, and the use of various punctuation (semicolons, commas, exclamation marks) to create emphasis or conversational complexity. It does not specify a minimum number of punctuation marks, nor does it restrict the set to a particular subset. Instead, it considers the overall structural and emotional complexity of the text.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation and emotional or structural complexity, the ground truth rule is more quantitative and specific, whereas the generated rule is qualitative and broader. They may produce similar classifications in some cases—particularly when multiple punctuation marks indicate complexity—but they are not equivalent in logic or criteria.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not describing the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
