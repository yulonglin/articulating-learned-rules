The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of explicit negative language. The Generated Rule emphasizes negative or problematic experiences related to service, quality, or delivery issues, which aligns with criticism but also broadens to include specific aspects of the experience. While they largely overlap in identifying negative reviews, the Generated Rule may include reviews that mention issues without explicitly stating dissatisfaction, and it also explicitly excludes neutral or positive reviews. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
