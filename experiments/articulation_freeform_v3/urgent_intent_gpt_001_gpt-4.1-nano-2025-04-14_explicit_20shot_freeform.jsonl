The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the core concept of urgency. The Generated Rule explicitly lists specific urgent, time-sensitive phrases (e.g., \"as soon as possible,\" \"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" etc.) that serve as indicators of such urgency. While the Ground Truth is more general and conceptual, the Generated Rule operationalizes this concept with concrete examples, making it more precise.\n\nThey would likely produce very similar classifications on most inputs, especially those containing the specified phrases. However, the Ground Truth might also include texts that imply urgency without explicitly using the listed phrases, whereas the Generated Rule relies on those explicit indicators. This slight difference accounts for the high but not perfect score.\n\nOverall, the core concept—identifying texts that demand immediate attention—is equivalent, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
