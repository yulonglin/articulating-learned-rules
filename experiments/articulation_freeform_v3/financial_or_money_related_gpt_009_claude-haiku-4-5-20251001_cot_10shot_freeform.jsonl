The Ground Truth Rule broadly states that the text discusses finance, money, banking, or investments, which captures the core subject area. The Generated Rule adds more detail by including money management and financial regulations for true cases, and explicitly mentions unrelated topics like nature, art, recreation, or mystery-solving for false cases. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial content versus unrelated topics—and would likely produce similar classifications in most cases. However, the Generated Rule's additional specifics and explicit mention of classification criteria (e.g., about personal or institutional finance) make it slightly more detailed and nuanced. Despite this, the core concept—distinguishing finance-related content from unrelated topics—is consistent.\n\nTherefore, they are largely aligned in their classification logic, but the Generated Rule's extra details prevent a perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
