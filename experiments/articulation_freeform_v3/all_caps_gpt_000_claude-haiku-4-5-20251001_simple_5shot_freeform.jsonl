The Ground Truth requires all alphabetic characters to be uppercase and at least one letter present, which effectively means the input must contain only uppercase alphabetic characters (since the presence of at least one letter is necessary). The Generated Rule states that the entire input must be in ALL CAPS, which generally implies all characters are uppercase letters, but it does not specify whether non-alphabetic characters are allowed or ignored. \n\nIn most cases, both rules will classify inputs similarly—inputs that are fully uppercase letters will be labeled True, and others False. However, the Ground Truth explicitly requires at least one letter and only considers alphabetic characters, whereas the Generated Rule's phrasing \"entire input is in ALL CAPS\" could be interpreted as including non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, digits) as long as the alphabetic characters are uppercase, which might lead to slight differences in classification.\n\nOverall, the core concept—checking for all uppercase letters—is shared, but the precise conditions differ slightly, preventing a perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
