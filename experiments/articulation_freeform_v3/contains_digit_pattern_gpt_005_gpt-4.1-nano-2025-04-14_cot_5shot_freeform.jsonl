The generated rule, however, broadly classifies inputs based on the presence of a meaningful number (like a score or room number), which may or may not be exactly three digits, and emphasizes the significance of the number rather than its specific pattern. While both rules involve numbers, the ground truth is pattern-specific, whereas the generated rule is conceptually more about the presence of meaningful numeric information. They share some overlap in that both involve numbers, but they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
