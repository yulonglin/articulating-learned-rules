The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule broadly captures negative, problematic, or unsatisfactory experiences or issues, which aligns with the core concept of identifying dissatisfaction or criticism. While the Generated Rule also includes \"unsatisfactory\" and \"issues,\" which may encompass a slightly broader set of situations, in practice, they largely overlap in identifying negative or problematic content. The main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, whereas the Generated Rule includes a wider range of negative descriptors. Overall, they describe similar classification logic with minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
