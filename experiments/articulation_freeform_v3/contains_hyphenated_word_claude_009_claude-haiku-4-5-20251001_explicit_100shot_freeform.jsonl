The Ground Truth explicitly states that the input is True if it contains at least one hyphen-connected word (e.g., \"well-known\"). The Generated Rule emphasizes hyphenated adjectives or descriptive phrases that convey qualities or attributes, providing examples like \"goal-oriented\" and \"state-of-the-art,\" which align with the core concept of hyphenated compounds indicating descriptive qualities.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule introduces additional nuance by specifying that the absence of hyphenated adjectives, combined with the presence of narrative events, actions, or scenes, leads to a False classification. It also broadens the scope to include \"descriptive phrases\" and explicitly mentions the context of describing qualities or attributes, which is consistent but slightly more detailed than the Ground Truth.\n\nThe main difference lies in the scope: the Ground Truth is strictly about the presence of hyphenated words, regardless of context, while the Generated Rule emphasizes the descriptive nature of the hyphenated phrases and explicitly distinguishes between descriptive adjectives and narrative content. Despite this, the core pattern—hyphenated compounds indicating descriptive qualities—is shared.\n\nTherefore, they largely identify the same key feature but differ slightly in scope and emphasis, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9791666666666666,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":48,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":2,"accuracy":0.9791666666666666},"parse_error":false}
