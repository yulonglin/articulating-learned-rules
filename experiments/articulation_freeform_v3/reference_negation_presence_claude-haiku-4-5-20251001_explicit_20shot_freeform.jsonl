The Ground Truth rule states that any negation word results in a negative classification, regardless of other content. The Generated rule specifies explicit negation or denial words/phrases, including common contractions and variations, to determine negativity. They largely align in identifying negation as the key feature. However, the Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of any negation word regardless of context, while the Generated rule explicitly mentions \"explicit negation or denial,\" which may imply a slightly more cautious or detailed approach. Additionally, the generated rule includes specific examples (\"don't,\" \"doesn't,\" etc.), which may or may not cover all negation words in the ground truth. Overall, they are very similar in core concept and would produce similar classifications on most inputs, but slight differences in phrasing and scope prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
