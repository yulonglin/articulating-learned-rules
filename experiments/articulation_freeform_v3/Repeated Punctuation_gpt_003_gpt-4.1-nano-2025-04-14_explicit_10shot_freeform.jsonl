The Ground Truth emphasizes \"three or more identical punctuation marks,\" while the Generated Rule states \"at least one sequence of three or more consecutive punctuation marks,\" which is essentially the same pattern. The phrasing differs slightly—one mentions \"sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks,\" the other \"sequence of three or more consecutive punctuation marks\"—but these are equivalent concepts. Both rules focus on detecting a run of three or more identical punctuation characters, and they would generally produce the same classifications on most inputs. The only minor difference is the explicit mention of \"consecutive\" in the generated rule, but this is implied in the \"sequence\" description. Overall, the core concept and pattern detection are aligned, making them effectively equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
