The Ground Truth specifies particular date formats ('DD/MM/YYYY' or 'Month Day, Year'), focusing on specific patterns. The Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of a \"specific, concrete date\" in any format, which broadly covers the same concept but is less precise about formats. They generally align in identifying date references as positive indicators, leading to similar classifications in most cases. However, the Generated Rule's broader wording might include some references that are not strictly in the specified formats, or conversely, miss some if the date is implied rather than explicit. Overall, their core concept—detecting a date—is equivalent, but the specificity differs slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
