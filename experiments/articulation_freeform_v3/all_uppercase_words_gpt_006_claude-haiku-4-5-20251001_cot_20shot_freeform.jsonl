The ground truth emphasizes that each word must consist entirely of uppercase letters, while the generated rule states that the entire text must be in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, which is essentially the same condition. The main difference is in phrasing: the ground truth focuses on individual words, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the entire text being in uppercase. They identify the same key feature—uppercase letters in all words—and would produce identical classifications in most cases. The slight difference in wording does not significantly affect the core logic, making them nearly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
