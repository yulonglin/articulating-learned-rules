The Ground Truth rule explicitly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which is a straightforward pattern. The Generated rule describes the same pattern but adds that True examples contain sentences about financial topics, while False examples are about general or unrelated subjects, emphasizing the presence or absence of financial content. \n\nThey largely share the same key features—financial content as the core criterion—and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly mentions the distinction between True and False examples and their content, whereas the Ground Truth rule simply states the topics involved. This makes their core concepts aligned, but the phrasing and emphasis differ slightly.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in classification logic, but not perfectly identical, hence a score of 8.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
