The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the content's intent. The Generated Rule broadens this by including specific keywords (\"now,\" \"immediately,\" \"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"emergency,\" \"without delay\") to operationalize the detection of urgency, and explicitly states that non-urgent, routine, or casual language should be classified as false.\n\nThe core concept—detecting urgency or emergency—is consistent between the two. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly lists keywords and phrases, which may slightly expand or restrict the scope compared to the more general description in the Ground Truth. However, both rules fundamentally aim to classify texts based on the presence of urgent or critical language.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in intent and general logic, but the explicit keyword-based approach in the Generated Rule introduces a slight difference in implementation, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
