The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of urgent or emergency language, while the Generated Rule explicitly lists specific keywords, situations, and phrases associated with urgency, including explicit markers, crisis situations, commands, and time-sensitive phrases. They share core concepts such as detecting urgency, emergency situations, and immediate action cues.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule provides a more detailed and structured set of patterns, including specific keywords and examples, whereas the Ground Truth is more general and conceptual. The generated rule might be more precise in identifying urgent texts based on explicit markers, but both rules fundamentally target the same core idea: recognizing language indicating immediate or urgent action.\n\nThey would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs, especially those containing clear urgency indicators. Slight differences might occur in edge cases where the language is less explicit or more nuanced, but overall, their classification logic aligns closely.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
