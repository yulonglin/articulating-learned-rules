The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text indicates an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on explicit language signaling urgency or importance (e.g., \"urgent,\" \"review and act today,\" \"get this done right away\"). The Generated Rule also clarifies that the absence of such language corresponds to False examples, matching the Ground Truth's implication that routine or informational content is not classified as True.\n\nHowever, the Ground Truth rule is somewhat broader and less explicitly detailed about specific keywords or phrases, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly mentions certain words and provides a clear criterion. Despite this, the core concept—identifying statements that demand immediate attention—is consistent.\n\nTherefore, they largely describe the same classification logic, with minor differences in phrasing and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
