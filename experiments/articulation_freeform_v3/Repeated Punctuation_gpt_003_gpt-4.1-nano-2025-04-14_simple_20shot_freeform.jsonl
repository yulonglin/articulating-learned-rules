The generated rule broadly describes the presence of multiple punctuation marks that convey strong emotion or emphasis, such as multiple exclamation points or ellipses, but does not specify the exact pattern or the minimum number of repetitions. While both rules aim to detect punctuation used for emphasis or emotional expression, the ground truth emphasizes a specific pattern (three or more identical marks), whereas the generated rule is more general and interpretive. Consequently, they will often agree but may diverge on certain inputs—e.g., a sentence with two exclamation points (not meeting the ground truth threshold but possibly considered expressive in the generated rule). Therefore, they are related but not perfectly aligned in their core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
