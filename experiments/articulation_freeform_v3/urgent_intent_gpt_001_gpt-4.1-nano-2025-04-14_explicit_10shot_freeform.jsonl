The Generated rule specifies that texts are labeled True if they explicitly mention words or phrases like \"urgent,\" \"as soon as possible,\" \"right away,\" \"today,\" etc., which are concrete indicators of urgency or immediacy. Both rules aim to identify texts that call for immediate action, but the Ground Truth is somewhat broader, potentially including implicit expressions of urgency not captured by specific keywords, whereas the Generated rule relies on explicit phrases. Therefore, they largely overlap in identifying urgent requests but may differ in edge cases. Overall, they share the core concept of urgency and immediacy but differ slightly in their approach—one more implicit, the other more explicit.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
