The False cases lack such urgency indicators and instead mention routine or informational content without any sense of immediacy. \n\nRule:  \nA statement is classified as True if it explicitly expresses urgency or immediacy through words or phrases like \"as soon as possible,\" \"right away,\" \"urgent,\" or similar; otherwise, it is False.","keyword_match_score":0.16666666666666666,"rouge_l_score":0.09523809523809523,"llm_judge_score":0.7,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which suggests a focus on the intent and context indicating urgency. The Generated rule specifies explicit keywords or phrases (\"as soon as possible,\" \"right away,\" \"urgent\") that signal urgency or immediacy. While both rules aim to identify urgent requests, the Ground Truth may encompass a broader understanding of urgency beyond specific phrases, potentially capturing implied or contextual urgency. Conversely, the Generated rule relies on explicit keywords, which might miss some nuanced or implied cases. Therefore, they largely overlap in identifying urgent requests but differ slightly in scope and approach, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
