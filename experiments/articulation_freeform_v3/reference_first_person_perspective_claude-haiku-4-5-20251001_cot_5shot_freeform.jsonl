The Generated Rule centers on whether the cases involve personal plans, intentions, or possessions reflecting the speaker's involvement, and distinguishes these from external observations or impersonal actions. While both rules aim to capture personal relevance, the Ground Truth rule explicitly relies on linguistic perspective, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes the nature of the content (plans, possessions, intentions) and its relation to the speaker. They overlap in identifying personal involvement but differ in their key features: perspective versus content type. Consequently, they would largely agree on many cases involving personal statements but may diverge on cases where perspective and content do not align perfectly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
