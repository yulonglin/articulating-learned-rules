The generated rule broadens this to include \"positive or intense emotional states or reactions\" and considers the absence of \"strong emotion\" as neutral or subdued, which may exclude some emotions (e.g., subtle sadness or anger) that the ground truth would include. While both rules aim to identify emotional expressions, the generated rule emphasizes positivity and intensity, potentially leading to different classifications in borderline cases. Therefore, they share some core concepts but are not fully aligned, resulting in partial overlap.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
