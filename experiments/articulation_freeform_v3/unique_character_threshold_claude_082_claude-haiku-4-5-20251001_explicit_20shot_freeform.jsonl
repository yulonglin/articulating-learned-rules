In contrast, the generated rule classifies sentences based on their structural complexity and descriptive content, emphasizing syntactic and stylistic features rather than character counts. While both rules aim to distinguish \"simple\" from \"complex\" sentences, they do so based on fundamentally different features. The ground truth rule does not consider sentence structure or descriptive elements, only character diversity, whereas the generated rule explicitly targets sentence complexity and descriptive language. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, would not necessarily produce the same classifications, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
