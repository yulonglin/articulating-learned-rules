The generated rule, however, broadly describes the presence of multiple punctuation marks used to convey emotion, hesitation, emphasis, or dramatic effect, without specifying the number or sequence length. It also emphasizes the emotional or expressive intent behind the punctuation rather than the exact pattern.\n\nWhile both rules recognize that expressive or emphatic punctuation indicates a positive classification, the ground truth rule is more precise about the pattern (three or more identical marks), whereas the generated rule is more general and interpretive, considering the overall emotional tone conveyed by punctuation. Consequently, they would agree on many inputs involving expressive punctuation, but the generated rule might classify some texts as positive based on emotional punctuation that do not contain the specific sequence of three or more identical marks, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent in their core logic, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
