The generated rule, however, labels texts as True if they contain at least one exclamation mark **and** are positive, enthusiastic, or appreciative in tone, adding an additional semantic dimension. While both rules consider exclamation marks as a key feature, the generated rule introduces a tone-based criterion that the ground truth rule does not specify. Consequently, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would produce different classifications in many cases—particularly for texts with one exclamation mark or texts with multiple exclamation marks but lacking the positive tone. The core concept of exclamation marks is shared, but the conditions differ significantly, reducing their equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
