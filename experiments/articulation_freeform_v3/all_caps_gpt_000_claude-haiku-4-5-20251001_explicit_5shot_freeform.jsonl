The Ground Truth emphasizes that all alphabetic characters are uppercase and that there is at least one letter, which aligns with the Generated Rule's condition that the entire text (excluding punctuation and spaces) is in ALL CAPS. The main difference is that the Ground Truth explicitly requires at least one letter, whereas the Generated Rule implicitly assumes that if the entire text is in all caps, there must be at least one letter. Both rules exclude punctuation and spaces from consideration, focusing solely on letter case. The slight difference in phrasing does not significantly affect the core logic. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same pattern, earning a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
