The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative experiences or complaints, and explicitly states that neutral or positive descriptions are false. They largely overlap in identifying negative or critical content, but the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"problems, failures, or issues,\" which may slightly broaden the scope beyond explicit dissatisfaction. Overall, they are very similar in core concept and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs, but the slight difference in phrasing and scope prevents a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
