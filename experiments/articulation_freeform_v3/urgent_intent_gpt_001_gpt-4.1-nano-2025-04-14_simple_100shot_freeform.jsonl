The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which is a broad concept. The Generated Rule specifies that the output is True when the message contains urgent language or commands indicating immediate action, emergency situations, or critical requests, with examples like \"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" \"now,\" \"evacuate,\" or references to emergencies.\n\nWhile the core concept—detecting urgent, immediate, or emergency-related messages—is shared, the Generated Rule explicitly lists specific keywords and scenarios, making it somewhat more detailed. The Ground Truth is more general, not specifying particular words but focusing on the overall indication of urgency or immediate action.\n\nMost inputs that contain explicit urgent language or emergency references would be classified similarly by both rules. However, the Ground Truth might also include messages that imply urgency without using the specific keywords listed in the Generated Rule, leading to some divergence.\n\nOverall, they describe similar classification logic with some differences in specificity, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
