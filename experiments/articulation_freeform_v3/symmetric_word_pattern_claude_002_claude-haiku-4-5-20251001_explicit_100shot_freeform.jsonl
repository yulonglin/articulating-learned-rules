The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of *any* such word, while the Generated Rule explicitly lists examples and clarifies the classification based on the presence or absence of such words. The core concept—identifying palindromic words—is consistent across both. The slight difference is that the generated rule provides examples and a formal classification structure, but this does not significantly alter the underlying logic. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in identifying the same pattern, with only minor differences in presentation.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
