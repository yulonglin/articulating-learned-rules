The generated rule, however, considers a broader set of emotional and subjective cues—doubt, concern, negative expectations, or difficult experiences—regardless of explicit negation words. While there may be some overlap (e.g., negative statements often express doubt or concern), the generated rule captures a wider range of negative or negative-leaning sentiments that are not necessarily marked by negation words. Conversely, the ground truth rule might classify statements as negative solely based on negation words, even if the overall sentiment is neutral or positive. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would often differ, especially in cases where negativity is implied without explicit negation.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
