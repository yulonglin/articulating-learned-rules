The generated rule, however, describes positive cases as containing emphatic punctuation (multiple exclamation marks, ellipsis, or question marks) and/or expressing strong emotional reactions or direct engagement, emphasizing emotional tone and expressive markers rather than a specific punctuation pattern. It also includes qualitative aspects like emotional reactions and tone, which are not explicitly part of the ground truth rule.\n\nWhile both rules recognize emphatic punctuation as a feature, the generated rule broadens the criteria to include emotional and interpersonal cues, potentially capturing a wider range of positive texts but also risking inclusion of texts that do not meet the strict punctuation pattern. Conversely, the ground truth rule is more precise and restrictive.\n\nTherefore, they do not identify exactly the same key features, and their classifications would differ on some inputs—particularly those with emotional tone but without the specific punctuation pattern, or vice versa. They share some core concepts related to emphasis and emotional tone but are not equivalent in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
