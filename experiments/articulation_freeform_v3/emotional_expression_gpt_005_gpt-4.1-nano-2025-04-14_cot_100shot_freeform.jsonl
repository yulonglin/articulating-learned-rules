The Ground Truth explicitly mentions conveying a \"clear emotional state\" like happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"emotional, psychological, or internal experience\" and lists feelings like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or overwhelm, emphasizing internal experiences over external or neutral descriptions.\n\nWhile the core concept—detecting emotional or internal states—is consistent, the phrasing differs. The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state,\" whereas the Generated Rule includes a wider range of internal experiences and explicitly mentions that neutral or factual content is labeled false. The inclusion of \"fear\" and \"overwhelm\" in the generated rule adds some nuance, but overall, both rules aim to classify statements based on emotional content.\n\nMost inputs that express emotions would be classified similarly under both rules, but the broader phrasing and additional examples in the generated rule could lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
