The Ground Truth focuses on the presence of negation words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never,\" regardless of other content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include negative expressions such as \"won't,\" \"doesn't,\" \"haven't,\" \"don't,\" which are contractions of negations, and explicitly states the output as True when such expressions are present. \n\nThey essentially identify the same key features—negation or negative expressions—and would largely produce the same classifications. However, the Ground Truth does not specify the inclusion of contractions like \"won't\" or \"doesn't,\" which are common negation forms. The Generated Rule explicitly includes these, making it slightly more comprehensive.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in core concept and would agree on most inputs, but the slight difference in the explicit mention of contractions accounts for a small discrepancy, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
