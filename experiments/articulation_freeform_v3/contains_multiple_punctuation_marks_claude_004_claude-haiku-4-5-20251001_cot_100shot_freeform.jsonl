In contrast, the generated rule emphasizes the emotional or expressive quality of the text, considering punctuation variety, emotional/emphatic markers, and conversational cues, rather than just the count of punctuation marks. While both rules may often agree—texts with many punctuation marks are likely to be emotionally expressive—they do not always align. For example, a text with three punctuation marks (per the ground truth) could be neutral and factual, which the generated rule would classify as False. Conversely, a text with fewer punctuation marks but rich in emotional markers might be classified as True by the generated rule but False by the ground truth. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not equivalent in their core logic or criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
