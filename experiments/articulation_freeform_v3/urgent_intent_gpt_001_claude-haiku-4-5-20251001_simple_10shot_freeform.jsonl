The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the intent and context of urgency. The Generated Rule specifies particular keywords (\"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"right away,\" etc.) and clarifies that the output is True when such language appears, and False otherwise. \n\nThey largely align in identifying urgent, time-sensitive language as the key feature. However, the Ground Truth is more conceptual, potentially capturing implicit urgency beyond specific keywords, while the Generated Rule relies on explicit terms. This difference means they would generally produce similar classifications but might diverge in edge cases where urgency is implied without the specified keywords.\n\nOverall, their core concepts are equivalent, but the reliance on explicit keywords in the generated rule introduces slight divergence from the more conceptual approach of the ground truth.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
