It focuses solely on the presence of a sequence of three digits in a row.\n\nThe Generated Rule, however, introduces additional conditions: it considers sequences of exactly three identical digits (e.g., 999, 888) and explicitly lists certain embedded number patterns (like 007, 123, 456, etc.), which may be part of larger numbers or embedded within words. It also emphasizes specific patterns that are standalone or embedded, and includes a broader set of examples.\n\nWhile both rules recognize the importance of sequences of three digits, the Generated Rule extends beyond the core concept by including specific patterns and emphasizing identical digits and certain embedded numbers. It also appears to consider the context or embedding of these patterns, which the Ground Truth does not specify.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent in scope or focus. The core idea of detecting three consecutive digits is shared, but the additional patterns and conditions in the Generated Rule mean they do not describe the same classification logic precisely.\n\nOverall, the similarity is partial, but the differences are significant enough to lower the score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
