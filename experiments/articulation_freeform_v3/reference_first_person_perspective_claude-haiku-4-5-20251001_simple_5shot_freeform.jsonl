The Ground Truth explicitly states the use of first-person perspective (I, me, my, we, us), emphasizing personal perspective. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"personal plan, experience, or possession\" and clarifies that the output is True when the input involves personal agency or ownership, and False otherwise. \n\nWhile the core concept—distinguishing personal involvement from general observations—is consistent, the Generated Rule introduces slightly broader criteria (\"personal plan, experience, or possession\") and emphasizes the nature of the description (personal vs. general). It does not explicitly mention first-person pronouns but implies personal involvement through these categories.\n\nMost inputs that involve first-person references or direct personal actions would be classified similarly under both rules. However, the Generated Rule might include some inputs involving personal plans or possessions that do not explicitly use first-person pronouns, which the Ground Truth might exclude if it strictly relies on pronouns.\n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying personal involvement is aligned, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
