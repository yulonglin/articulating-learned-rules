The generated rule, however, broadly states classifying as positive if a specific calendar date (with explicit day, month, and year) appears, and negative if only vague or relative time references are present. While both rules emphasize the presence of explicit, concrete dates, the ground truth rule explicitly mentions particular date formats, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of a specific calendar date regardless of format. Additionally, the generated rule explicitly excludes vague or relative references, which the ground truth rule does not explicitly address. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but differ in detail and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
