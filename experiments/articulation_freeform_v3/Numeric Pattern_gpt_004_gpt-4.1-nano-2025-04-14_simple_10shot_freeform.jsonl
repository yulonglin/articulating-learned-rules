The generated rule broadly describes the presence of a date or date-related phrase, including mentions of specific dates or events on particular days, which may encompass various expressions beyond the exact formats specified. While both rules aim to identify date references, the generated rule is more flexible and less precise, potentially capturing mentions that do not match the exact formats of the ground truth. Therefore, they share a core concept—detecting date references—but differ significantly in the specific patterns and criteria used, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
