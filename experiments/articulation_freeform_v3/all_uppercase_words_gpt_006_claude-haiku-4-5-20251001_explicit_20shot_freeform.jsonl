The Ground Truth emphasizes that all words consist entirely of uppercase letters, which implies no lowercase or mixed case. The Generated Rule states that the text is written entirely in UPPERCASE letters, and False otherwise, which aligns closely with the same pattern. The main difference is that the Ground Truth explicitly mentions \"all words\" are uppercase, while the generated rule refers to the entire text being in uppercase, which generally covers the same concept. The slight difference in phrasing does not significantly affect the core logic, and they would produce identical classifications on most inputs. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in their classification criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
