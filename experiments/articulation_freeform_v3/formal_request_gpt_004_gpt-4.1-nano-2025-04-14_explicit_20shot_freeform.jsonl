The generated rule specifies that a text should be labeled True if it contains polite, formal requests or inquiries that are phrased with specific modal verbs or polite expressions seeking permission, information, or action. While both rules focus on politeness and formality, the generated rule introduces concrete linguistic patterns (e.g., \"could you,\" \"may I please\") and explicitly mentions seeking permission, information, or action, which are not explicitly included in the ground truth. \n\nThey generally aim to identify similar types of texts—polite, formal requests—but the generated rule is more detailed and pattern-based, potentially capturing more specific instances. However, it might also miss some polite requests that do not use the specified expressions or modal verbs, whereas the ground truth is more inclusive of the overall tone and intent. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but differ in specificity and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
