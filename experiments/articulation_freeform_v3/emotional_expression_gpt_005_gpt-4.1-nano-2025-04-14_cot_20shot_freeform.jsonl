The Generated rule broadens this to include \"joyful\" and \"personally meaningful experiences,\" which are related but slightly more specific or subjective, and also explicitly distinguishes neutral, factual, or impersonal descriptions as negative cases. While both rules aim to identify emotionally charged content, the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit emotional states, whereas the Generated rule incorporates a broader notion of meaningfulness and personal significance. They would largely agree on many inputs but may diverge on subtle cases—e.g., a sentence conveying personal significance without explicit emotional language might be classified differently. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned in key features and classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
