The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on direct mentions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule broadens this by including expressions of \"negative experience, complaint, or dissatisfaction\" and clarifies that neutral or positive descriptions should be classified as false. While the phrasing differs—one emphasizes explicit criticism, the other emphasizes negative experiences—the core concept of detecting negative or dissatisfied sentiments is aligned. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes complaints and negative experiences, which may encompass more subtle or indirect expressions than the Ground Truth's focus on explicit statements. Overall, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, but the slight difference in scope accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
