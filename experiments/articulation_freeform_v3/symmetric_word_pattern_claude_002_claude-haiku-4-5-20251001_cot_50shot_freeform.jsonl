The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of \"at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which is the core pattern. The Generated Rule explicitly states the same condition, providing examples of palindromic words and clarifying the classification criterion. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly lists examples and clarifies the classification process, but the fundamental concept—detecting at least one palindromic word—is the same. They are effectively equivalent in identifying the same pattern, with only minor differences in phrasing and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
