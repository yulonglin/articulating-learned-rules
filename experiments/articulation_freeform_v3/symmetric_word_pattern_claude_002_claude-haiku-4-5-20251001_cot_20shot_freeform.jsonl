The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of \"at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" while the Generated Rule explicitly states that the classification is True if and only if such a palindromic word exists, listing examples for clarity. The core concept—detecting at least one palindromic word—is consistent between both. The main difference is in phrasing and detail: the generated rule explicitly states the classification condition as \"if and only if,\" and provides examples, but these do not alter the fundamental logic. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same pattern and would produce the same classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
