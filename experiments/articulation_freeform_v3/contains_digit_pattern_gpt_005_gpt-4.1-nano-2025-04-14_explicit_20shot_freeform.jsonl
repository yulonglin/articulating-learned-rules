The generated rule classifies inputs as True if they contain a number that is a multiple of 3, which is a different criterion—here, the key feature is the numerical value being divisible by 3, regardless of the number's length or position. These rules do not identify the same key features; they would often produce different classifications, especially for inputs with multiple digits or varying patterns. While both involve digits, their core concepts are not equivalent, leading to minimal overlap in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
