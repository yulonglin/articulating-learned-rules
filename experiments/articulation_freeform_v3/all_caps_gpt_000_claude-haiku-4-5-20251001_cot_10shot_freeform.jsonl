The ground truth emphasizes that all alphabetic characters are uppercase and that the input contains at least one letter, implicitly allowing non-letter characters. The generated rule explicitly states that the entire text must be in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS with no lowercase letters, which aligns with the requirement that all alphabetic characters are uppercase. \n\nHowever, the generated rule's phrasing \"entire text is written in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS (with no lowercase letters mixed in)\" could be interpreted as requiring the entire string, including non-letter characters, to be uppercase, which is slightly more restrictive than the ground truth, which only concerns alphabetic characters. Despite this subtle difference, in typical interpretation, both rules effectively classify the same set of inputs.\n\nTherefore, they describe very similar, mostly overlapping classification logic, earning a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
