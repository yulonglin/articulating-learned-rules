The Ground Truth specifies \"a polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on the tone and type of communication. The Generated rule broadens this to include inquiries related to official processes, opportunities, or services, and explicitly distinguishes these from casual or descriptive statements. While there is significant overlap—both target formal requests/applications—the Generated rule introduces additional categories (inquiries about official processes, grants, etc.) and explicitly excludes casual or informational statements, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly mention. Therefore, they largely align but differ slightly in scope and specificity, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
