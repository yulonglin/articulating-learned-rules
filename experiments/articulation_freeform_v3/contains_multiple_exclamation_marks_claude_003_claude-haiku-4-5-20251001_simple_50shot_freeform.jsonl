The Generated Rule, however, broadens the criteria to include multiple types of punctuation (e.g., multiple exclamation marks, multiple question marks, or other combinations) that convey strong emotion or emphasis, and explicitly excludes neutral or calm statements, even if they contain a single punctuation mark. While both rules consider punctuation as a key feature, the Generated Rule incorporates additional punctuation patterns and contextual emphasis, making it more complex and less directly aligned with the simple count-based approach of the Ground Truth. They share the core idea of punctuation conveying emphasis but differ significantly in scope and specific patterns considered.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
