The Ground Truth emphasizes that each word must be \"entirely of uppercase letters,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's condition that the entire text is written in ALL UPPERCASE letters. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly states \"if and only if,\" reinforcing the equivalence, and clarifies that false cases may involve standard or mixed-case text. Overall, they identify the same key feature—complete uppercase text—and would largely produce the same classifications. The slight difference in phrasing and emphasis accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
