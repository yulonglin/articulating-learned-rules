The Ground Truth emphasizes the text being a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on the nature of the statement itself. The Generated rule broadens this by including inquiries seeking permission, assistance, or action, and explicitly states the output is True in these cases, False otherwise. While both rules target similar patterns—politeness, formality, and request-like intent—they differ slightly in scope: the Ground Truth emphasizes the form and type of communication, whereas the Generated rule explicitly includes seeking permission or help and clarifies the classification based on the intent. They largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned, especially regarding the scope of what constitutes a request or application.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
