The Ground Truth specifies \"any negation words (like 'not', 'no', 'never') regardless of other content,\" emphasizing the presence of negation words as the key feature. The Generated Rule broadens this slightly by including \"words like 'won't,' 'doesn't,' 'don't,'\" and mentions \"negative sentiment,\" which could imply considering words with negative connotations beyond explicit negation. \n\nHowever, both rules essentially aim to flag sentences containing negation or negative cues as negative. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly mentions negative sentiment, which could potentially include words with negative connotations that are not strictly negation words, whereas the ground truth focuses solely on negation words.\n\nMost inputs containing negation words will be classified similarly by both rules, leading to high overlap. The slight difference in phrasing and scope accounts for a small discrepancy, but overall, they describe very similar classification logic.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The core concept—detecting negation to classify as negative—is aligned, making the rules largely equivalent in intent and application.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
