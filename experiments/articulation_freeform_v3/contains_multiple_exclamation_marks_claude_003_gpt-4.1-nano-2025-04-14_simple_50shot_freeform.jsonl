The generated rule, however, considers any exclamation mark or multiple exclamation points (like \"!!\" or \"!!!\") as indicators of strong emotion or emphasis, which aligns with the presence of multiple exclamation marks but also introduces a broader interpretation that includes emotional tone and emphasis. While both rules are centered around exclamation marks, the generated rule's emphasis on conveying emotion and the inclusion of words like \"!!\" or \"!!!\" makes it more subjective and less precise than the ground truth. They would produce similar classifications in many cases involving multiple exclamation marks, but the generated rule might also classify some inputs as True based on emotional tone even if they don't contain two or more exclamation marks, leading to discrepancies.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
