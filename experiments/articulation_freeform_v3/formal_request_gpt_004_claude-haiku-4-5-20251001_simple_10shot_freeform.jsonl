The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text is a polite, formal request or application, focusing on the tone and nature of the request. The Generated Rule broadens this to include formal requests or inquiries related to applications, enrollments, procedures, or official opportunities, and explicitly states when to output False, emphasizing the context of formal processes.\n\nThey share the core concept of recognizing formal, official requests or inquiries about applications or opportunities. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes a wider range of related topics (enrollments, procedures, official opportunities) and clarifies what constitutes a non-matching input (descriptive, casual, or general info). The Ground Truth is slightly narrower, focusing on polite, formal requests or applications, possibly implying a more specific tone.\n\nMost inputs that are formal requests or applications will be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule's broader scope and explicit negation criteria make it slightly more inclusive and detailed. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
