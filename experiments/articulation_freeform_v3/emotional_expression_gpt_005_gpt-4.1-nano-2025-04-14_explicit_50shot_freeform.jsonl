The Ground Truth emphasizes a \"clear emotional state\" without specifying the nature of the expression, while the Generated rule explicitly mentions \"emotional response,\" \"internal feelings,\" and \"subtle expressions,\" which are broader and more nuanced. They share the core concept of detecting emotional or internal states, but the generated rule includes additional qualifiers (\"subtle expressions,\" \"internal states\") that may lead to slightly different classifications, especially in borderline cases. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying emotional content but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, making them mostly aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
