The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on direct expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule broadens this to classify as True if there's a \"clear complaint, dissatisfaction, or negative experience,\" and as False if positive, neutral, or mixed. While the phrasing differs, the core concept—detecting negative or critical statements—is aligned. The main difference is that the Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of a \"clear\" complaint and explicitly includes \"specific problem\" examples, which may slightly expand or narrow the scope compared to the Ground Truth. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying negative or critical content, making them closely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
