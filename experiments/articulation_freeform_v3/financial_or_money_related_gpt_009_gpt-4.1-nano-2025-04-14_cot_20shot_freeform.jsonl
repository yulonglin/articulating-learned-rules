The Ground Truth rule states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which is a broad, inclusive pattern. The Generated rule elaborates that true examples relate specifically to financial or banking contexts, including investment strategies, regulations, or instruments, while false examples are about unrelated topics like nature or art. \n\nThey identify similar key features—namely, the relevance to finance and banking topics—and would generally produce the same classifications for most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated rule provides more detailed criteria and examples, whereas the Ground Truth rule is more general. Despite this, their core concepts are aligned, making them effectively equivalent in classification logic, with only minor differences in specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
