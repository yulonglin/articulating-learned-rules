The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the intent. The Generated Rule broadens this by including emphasis on urgency, importance, or time sensitivity through specific keywords like \"critical,\" \"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" and similar phrases. While the core concept of detecting urgency and immediate action is shared, the Generated Rule explicitly incorporates keyword-based signals, which may lead to slight differences in classification—potentially capturing more nuanced expressions or missing some implicit urgencies not using the specified words. Overall, they are very similar in intent and key features, but the Generated Rule's reliance on specific words introduces a slight divergence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
