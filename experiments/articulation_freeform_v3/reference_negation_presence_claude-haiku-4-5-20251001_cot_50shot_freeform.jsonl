The Ground Truth rule states that any negation word (like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never\") triggers a negative classification, regardless of other content. The Generated rule expands this to include specific negation phrases (\"no longer,\" \"won't,\" \"wouldn't,\" \"haven't,\" \"couldn't,\" \"don't,\" \"isn't,\" \"aren't\") and explicitly states that presence of these leads to a positive classification (True), implying the text is negative. \n\nThe main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth rule is more general, simply requiring any negation word, while the Generated rule explicitly lists certain negation words/phrases and clarifies the classification logic. They are aligned in core concept—negation words indicate negativity—but the generated rule's explicit listing and the framing of classification as True/False introduces slight differences in interpretation.\n\nOverall, they are very similar in intent and pattern detection, but the explicit listing and framing in the generated rule make them not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
