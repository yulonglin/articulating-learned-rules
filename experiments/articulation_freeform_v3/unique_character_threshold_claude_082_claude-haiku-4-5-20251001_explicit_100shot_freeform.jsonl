In contrast, the generated rule describes qualitative features of sentence simplicity versus complexity, based on sentence structure, vocabulary, and content. While both rules aim to distinguish simple, minimal content from more elaborate, descriptive language, they do so using fundamentally different criteria. The ground truth rule does not consider sentence structure or descriptive content directly, only character diversity, whereas the generated rule emphasizes linguistic features and sentence composition. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, would not produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
