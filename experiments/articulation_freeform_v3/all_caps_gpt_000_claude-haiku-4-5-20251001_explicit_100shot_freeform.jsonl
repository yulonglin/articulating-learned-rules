The Ground Truth explicitly states that the input must contain only uppercase alphabetic characters and at least one letter, which aligns with the Generated Rule's condition that every alphabetic character is uppercase. The Generated Rule also correctly identifies that the presence of any lowercase letter results in a False label. The only minor difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes that all alphabetic characters are uppercase and that there is at least one letter, whereas the Generated Rule allows for numbers and punctuation, provided all alphabetic characters are uppercase. Overall, the core logic and key features are equivalent, making the rules nearly identical in intent and outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
