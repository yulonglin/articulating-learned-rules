The generated rule, however, introduces additional semantic and tonal criteria—specifically, that the input must be in ALL CAPS *and* convey an imperative/command tone or express triumph/achievement. This broadens the classification to include contextual and tonal features beyond mere capitalization. As a result, the generated rule may classify inputs differently (e.g., uppercase statements lacking commanding or triumphant tone would be False under the generated rule but True under the ground truth). Conversely, the ground truth rule does not consider tone or meaning, only letter casing. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would often differ.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
