The Ground Truth emphasizes the first-person perspective explicitly and implies that the rule is written from that perspective. The Generated Rule also centers on first-person pronouns but adds that true cases involve personal reflection, decision-making, or individual experience, while false cases involve third-person perspective or objective observations without personal agency or introspection. \n\nWhile the core feature—use of first-person pronouns—is common to both, the Generated Rule introduces additional criteria related to personal reflection and decision-making, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Ground Truth. This could lead to differences in classification, especially in borderline cases where first-person pronouns are present but without reflection or decision-making.\n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying first-person perspective as a key feature but differ slightly in the scope of what constitutes a true case, making them similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
