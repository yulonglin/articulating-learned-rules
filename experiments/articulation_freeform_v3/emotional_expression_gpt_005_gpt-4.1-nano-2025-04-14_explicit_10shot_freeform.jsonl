The Ground Truth emphasizes the explicit conveyance of emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on clear emotional states. The Generated rule broadens this to include both explicit and implicit emotional responses, internal states, or subjective experiences, and explicitly mentions examples like frustration, dread, or surprise. While the core concept—detecting emotional or internal reactions—is consistent, the Generated rule's inclusion of implicit cues and a wider range of subjective experiences makes it slightly more inclusive. Consequently, they would largely produce similar classifications, but the Generated rule might classify some texts as positive or negative that the Ground Truth might not, or vice versa. Overall, they are very aligned in intent and pattern recognition, with minor differences in scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
