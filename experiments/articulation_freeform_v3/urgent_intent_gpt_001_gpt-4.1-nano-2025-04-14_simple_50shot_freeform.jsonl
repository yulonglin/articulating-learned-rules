The Ground Truth emphasizes an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the presence of urgency and immediacy. The Generated Rule specifies that the output is True when the message contains an urgent request or command requiring immediate action, assistance, or attention, often indicated by words like \"now,\" \"immediately,\" \"urgent,\" or similar expressions. \n\nWhile both rules target urgent, immediate requests, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader, emphasizing the general indication of urgency or immediate action, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly mentions specific keywords and the presence of commands. They largely overlap in identifying similar patterns, but the Generated Rule's reliance on specific words and explicit mention of commands may lead to slight differences in classification, especially in cases where urgency is implied but not explicitly signaled by the specified keywords.\n\nOverall, they describe similar core concepts but differ slightly in phrasing and explicitness, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
