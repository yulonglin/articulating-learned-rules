The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, while the Generated rule specifies particular topics (financial institutions, monetary policies, investments, banking-related topics) and explicitly states when to output True or False, including non-financial subjects. They share the core concept of identifying financial topics but differ slightly in scope and phrasing. The Generated rule is more detailed in defining what counts as financial and clarifies the negative cases, which may lead to slight differences in classification. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying financial content but are not perfectly aligned in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
