The generated rule specifies that a text is classified as true if it contains polite, courteous expressions like \"please,\" \"kindly,\" or \"would you be so kind,\" which are concrete indicators of politeness and formality. Both rules focus on politeness and formality as key features, but the ground truth emphasizes the overall intent and tone, while the generated rule relies on specific lexical cues. They would generally produce similar classifications when such courteous expressions are present, but the ground truth might also include texts that are polite and formal without explicitly using those specific phrases, potentially leading to some divergence. Overall, the core concepts—politeness and formality—are aligned, but the methods differ slightly in scope and explicitness.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
