The Ground Truth Rule specifies topics explicitly (finance, money, banking, investments), focusing on content related to these areas. The Generated Rule emphasizes whether the sentence discusses financial concepts or related economic activities, with a similar focus. While the phrasing differs—one uses specific topics, the other uses broader terms—the core pattern of identifying financial or economic content is aligned. They would largely produce the same classifications, though the Generated Rule might be slightly more inclusive or interpretive in its wording, leading to minor differences. Overall, they describe very similar classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
