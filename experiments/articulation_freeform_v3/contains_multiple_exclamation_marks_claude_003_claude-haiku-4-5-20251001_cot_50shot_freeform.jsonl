The Ground Truth specifies \"two or more exclamation marks\" anywhere in the input, while the Generated Rule specifies \"two or more consecutive exclamation marks.\" In most cases, these conditions will coincide because having two or more consecutive exclamation marks implies at least two total exclamation marks. However, the key difference is that the Ground Truth considers any two exclamation marks regardless of their position or adjacency, whereas the Generated Rule only considers consecutive exclamation marks. Therefore, they are very similar and will produce the same classification in most scenarios, but not all (e.g., an input with two separate exclamation marks separated by other characters would be classified as True by the Ground Truth but False by the Generated Rule). This makes their core concepts closely aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
