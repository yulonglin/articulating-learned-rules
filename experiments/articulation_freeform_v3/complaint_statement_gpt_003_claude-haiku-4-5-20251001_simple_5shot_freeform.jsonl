The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit mentions of dissatisfaction or criticism. The Generated Rule broadly captures negative experiences or complaints, including poor service, unmet expectations, or problems, which aligns with the core concept of negative sentiment. However, the Generated Rule also encompasses inputs that are simply negative or problematic without necessarily explicitly criticizing or stating dissatisfaction, and it explicitly includes neutral or average inputs as false. While the core concepts are similar, the phrasing and scope differ slightly, leading to some potential divergence in classification, especially in borderline cases. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
