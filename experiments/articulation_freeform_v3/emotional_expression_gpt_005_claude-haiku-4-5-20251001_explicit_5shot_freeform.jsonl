The Generated rule centers on the use of emotionally evocative or vivid descriptive language indicating intense feelings or dramatic atmosphere, which aligns with emotional expression but also includes strong language and descriptive intensity. While both rules aim to identify emotionally charged content, the Ground Truth is more about explicitly recognizing stated emotional states, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes language that evokes or suggests strong feelings, which may sometimes include vivid descriptions that do not directly state an emotion. Therefore, they overlap but are not perfectly aligned, leading to partial equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
