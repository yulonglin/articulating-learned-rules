The Ground Truth emphasizes that the sentence is written from a first-person perspective, implying personal involvement. The Generated rule explicitly states that classification depends on both the presence of first-person pronouns and the description of personal experiences, thoughts, decisions, or relationships, and it also considers third-person perspective or external observations as negative cues. \n\nWhile the core concept—identifying first-person perspective—is shared, the Generated rule adds an additional layer by requiring the description of personal involvement (experiences, thoughts, etc.), which the Ground Truth does not explicitly specify. This could lead to slight differences in classification, especially in cases where first-person pronouns are used but no personal experience or involvement is described.\n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying first-person perspective as the key feature, but the Generated rule's emphasis on describing personal experiences makes it slightly more specific. Therefore, they are very similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
