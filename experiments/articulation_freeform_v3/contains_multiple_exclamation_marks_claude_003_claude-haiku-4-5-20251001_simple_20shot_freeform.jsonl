The Generated Rule, however, emphasizes multiple exclamation marks (specifically \"!!\") but also incorporates additional contextual cues such as expressing excitement, urgency, or strong positive emotion, and considers the overall tone (e.g., neutral or factual content). This means the Generated Rule introduces subjective interpretation beyond just the punctuation pattern, potentially leading to different classifications in some cases. While both rules rely on multiple exclamation marks as a core indicator, the Generated Rule's broader contextual considerations make their logic only partially aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
