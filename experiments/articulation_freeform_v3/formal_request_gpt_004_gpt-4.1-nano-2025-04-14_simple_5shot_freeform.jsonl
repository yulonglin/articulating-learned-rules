The Generated rule, however, focuses specifically on whether the input contains a request or inquiry related to obtaining or renting something, and explicitly excludes descriptive or informational statements. While both rules involve identifying requests, the Ground Truth is broader, encompassing any polite, formal request or application, not limited to rental or acquisition inquiries. The Generated rule narrows the scope to specific types of requests (related to obtaining or renting), which may exclude some requests that are polite and formal but not about renting or obtaining. Therefore, they share some key features—requests and politeness—but differ in scope and specific patterns, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.54,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":27,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.54},"parse_error":false}
