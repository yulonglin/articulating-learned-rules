The ground truth explicitly states that the input is labeled True if all words are uppercase, which aligns with the generated rule's condition that the text is written entirely in uppercase letters. The main difference is in phrasing: the ground truth emphasizes \"all words consist entirely of uppercase letters,\" while the generated rule states \"Text is written entirely in UPPERCASE letters.\" Both capture the same core pattern—full uppercase text—though the generated rule does not explicitly mention the all-words condition, it is implied. They would produce the same classification on most inputs, especially straightforward cases. The core concept—uppercase-only text—is equivalent, making the rules effectively aligned, with minor differences in wording.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
