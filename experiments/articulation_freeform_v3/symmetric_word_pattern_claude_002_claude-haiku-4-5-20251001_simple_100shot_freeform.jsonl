The Ground Truth emphasizes \"text contains at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which directly aligns with the Generated Rule's description of \"at least one palindromic word.\" The main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth is more concise and general, while the Generated Rule explicitly lists examples and clarifies the classification. They identify the same key feature—presence of a palindromic word—and would produce identical classifications in most cases. The slight difference in wording and examples accounts for the small deduction.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
