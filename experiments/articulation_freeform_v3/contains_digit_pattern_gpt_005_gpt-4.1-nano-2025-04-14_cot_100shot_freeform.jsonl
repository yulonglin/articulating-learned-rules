The Generated Rule, however, broadens the criteria to include any sequence of digits (three or more) that appears in specific contexts like passwords, serial numbers, or phone numbers, and emphasizes the presence of standalone digit sequences rather than their exact length. While both rules involve sequences of digits, the generated rule is more permissive and context-dependent, and does not restrict to exactly three digits. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and would likely produce different classifications on many inputs. The core concept of digit sequences is shared, but the specifics differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
