The generated rule, however, describes a broader conceptual framework involving emotional intensity, completed actions, and emphasis, often marked by double exclamation marks or strong language, but also includes other forms of emotional emphasis beyond punctuation. It also classifies a wide range of statements (hypotheticals, thematic descriptions, neutral narratives) as False, which may not align perfectly with the ground truth's focus on punctuation. Therefore, while there is some overlap—particularly in recognizing emotional emphasis—the core features and patterns differ significantly, leading to only partial equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
