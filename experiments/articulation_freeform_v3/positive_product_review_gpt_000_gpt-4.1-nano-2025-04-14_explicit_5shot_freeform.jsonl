The Ground Truth specifies that the text must express a positive sentiment *specifically about a product or service*, focusing on the subject of the sentiment. The Generated Rule emphasizes detecting explicit positive or enthusiastic language indicating satisfaction or praise, and labels neutral, negative, or skeptical language as false. While the core concept of identifying positive sentiment is shared, the Ground Truth is more narrowly focused on the *subject* (product or service), whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the *language cues* (explicit positive or enthusiastic expressions). They would largely agree on most clearly positive texts, but the Generated Rule might include or exclude some texts differently depending on the presence of explicit language versus the context of the subject. Overall, they are similar but not perfectly aligned in phrasing or scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
