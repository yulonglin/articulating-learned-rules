The Ground Truth states \"all words consist entirely of uppercase letters,\" while the Generated Rule emphasizes that the entire input text is in ALL CAPS and contains no lowercase letters. They essentially describe the same pattern: the absence of any lowercase characters and the presence of only uppercase letters. The slight difference is that the Ground Truth focuses on \"all words\" being uppercase, which implicitly includes the entire input, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly states the entire input text is in uppercase. This difference is minimal and does not affect the core logic. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in classification criteria, earning a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
