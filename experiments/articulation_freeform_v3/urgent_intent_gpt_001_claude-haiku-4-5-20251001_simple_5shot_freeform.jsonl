The Ground Truth specifies that the text indicates an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the presence of urgency-related content. The Generated Rule describes the output as **True** when the input contains urgent language emphasizing immediate action or time sensitivity (e.g., \"urgent,\" \"must,\" \"right away,\" \"today\") and **False** otherwise.  \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting urgency—is shared, the Ground Truth emphasizes the overall indication of an urgent request or call for immediate action, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly lists specific keywords and phrases that signal urgency. The generated rule's reliance on specific words may miss some nuanced expressions of urgency not containing those exact terms, and it may also include some phrases that are urgent but not necessarily indicative of a request or call for action.  \n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying urgent, immediate-action language, but the generated rule's explicit keyword-based approach introduces some differences in scope and nuance.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
