The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on statements that \"express clear dissatisfaction, complaint, or negative experience\" and contain \"explicit criticism, problems, or disappointment.\" \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly mentions that neutral, positive, factual, or ambivalent statements are false cases, which adds a layer of clarification not explicitly present in the Ground Truth. This slight difference in phrasing and emphasis accounts for the score not being a perfect 10. Overall, the core concepts—detecting explicit dissatisfaction or criticism—are essentially the same, making the rules closely aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
