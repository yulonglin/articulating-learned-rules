It is precise and pattern-based, focusing solely on the occurrence of such sequences regardless of context or expressive intent.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes the use of expressive punctuation (multiple exclamation or question marks) to convey emotion like excitement, surprise, or emphasis, especially when used after or within a sentence. It introduces interpretive elements such as conveying emotion and contextual usage, which are not explicitly part of the ground truth rule.\n\nWhile both rules involve multiple punctuation marks, the ground truth is strictly pattern-based, whereas the generated rule incorporates semantic and pragmatic considerations. They would likely agree on many cases where the punctuation sequence is present, but the generated rule might classify some texts as positive based on expressive intent even if they do not contain a sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not fully equivalent in scope or specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
