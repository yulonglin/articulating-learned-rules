The Generated Rule, however, broadens this to include sequences of three or more consecutive digits, and adds contextual considerations—such as whether the digits appear as meaningful numbers or codes versus being part of standard formats like email addresses or phone numbers. While both rules center on detecting sequences of digits, the Generated Rule's allowance for longer sequences and its emphasis on context and meaningfulness introduce significant differences. Consequently, they would agree on some inputs (e.g., a string with exactly three digits) but diverge on many others, especially those with longer digit sequences or embedded in standard formats. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
