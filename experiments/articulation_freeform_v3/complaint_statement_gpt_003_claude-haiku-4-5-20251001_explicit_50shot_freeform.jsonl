The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of negative evaluation. The Generated Rule similarly centers on the expression of clear complaint or negative experience, with additional clarification that the negativity should be specific, substantial, and primary.\n\nWhile the Generated Rule introduces more detailed criteria—such as the negativity being \"specific, substantial, and the primary focus\"—these are consistent with the Ground Truth's emphasis on explicit dissatisfaction. The False category in the Generated Rule aligns with the Ground Truth's focus on the absence of explicit negativity, covering neutral, positive, or descriptive statements.\n\nThe main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly discusses the strength and focus of negativity, which adds nuance but does not fundamentally alter the core concept: identifying explicit dissatisfaction or criticism. Therefore, they largely describe the same classification logic, with minor differences in phrasing and emphasis.\n\nOverall, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, just articulated with slightly different wording and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
