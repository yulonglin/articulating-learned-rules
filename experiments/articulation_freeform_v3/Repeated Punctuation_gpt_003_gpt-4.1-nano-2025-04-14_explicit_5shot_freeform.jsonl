The generated rule, however, centers on explicit expressions of disbelief, surprise, or emphasis such as \"can't believe,\" \"really,\" or \"simple...,\" which are linguistic cues conveying strong sentiment but do not necessarily involve punctuation patterns. While both rules aim to identify strong or incredulous sentiment, they rely on different features—punctuation patterns versus lexical expressions. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., a text with \"Really!!!\" might be classified similarly), but generally, they do not identify the same key features and are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs. Therefore, their core concepts are different, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
