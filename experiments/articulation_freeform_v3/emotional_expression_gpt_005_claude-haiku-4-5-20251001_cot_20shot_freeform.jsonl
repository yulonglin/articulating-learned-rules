The Ground Truth emphasizes conveying a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the expression of an emotional state itself. The Generated rule broadens this to include explicit expressions or descriptions of emotional states, feelings, or reactions, and explicitly mentions that factual descriptions are not included. While the phrasing differs, both rules target the same core concept: identifying emotional content versus factual or non-emotional content. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly includes feelings and reactions, which aligns closely with the Ground Truth's focus. Therefore, they would largely produce similar classifications, with minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
