The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct mentions of dissatisfaction. The Generated Rule broadly defines negative or problematic experiences with examples (e.g., cold food, delays, broken products) and emphasizes issues or dissatisfaction as criteria for labeling True. They share the core concept of detecting negative or problematic feedback, but the Generated Rule includes a wider range of examples and slightly broader phrasing, which could potentially include some neutral or ambiguous cases if not carefully applied. Overall, they are very similar in intent and key features, but the Ground Truth is more explicitly focused on dissatisfaction, while the Generated Rule encompasses a broader set of negative indicators.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
