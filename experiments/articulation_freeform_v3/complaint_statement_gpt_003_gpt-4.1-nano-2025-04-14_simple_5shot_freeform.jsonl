The Generated Rule narrows the scope to negative experiences specifically related to waiting, delivery, or service, and emphasizes disappointment or negative feelings, but excludes neutral or average experiences. While both rules aim to identify negative sentiments, the Ground Truth is more general, and the Generated rule is more specific in context and types of experiences considered. They share the core concept of detecting negative sentiment but differ significantly in scope and key features, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
