In contrast, the generated rule focuses on linguistic features such as sentence simplicity, structure, tense, and descriptive language, which are qualitative and related to sentence content and form. These two rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; the first is a character-based criterion, while the second is a stylistic and syntactic criterion. They would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a sentence could be simple and short but contain many unique characters, or be complex but use few characters. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
