The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct mentions of dissatisfaction or critique. The Generated Rule broadly captures negative, problematic, or unsatisfactory experiences, which aligns with the core concept of criticism or dissatisfaction. They share key features—namely, identifying negative or problematic sentiments—and would likely produce similar classifications in most cases. However, the Generated Rule also encompasses \"unsatisfactory\" experiences that may not explicitly criticize or state dissatisfaction, potentially leading to some differences in borderline cases. Overall, the core concepts are very similar, but slight differences in phrasing and scope prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
