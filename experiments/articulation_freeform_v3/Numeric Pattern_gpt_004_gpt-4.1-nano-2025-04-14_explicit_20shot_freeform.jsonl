The ground truth specifies two exact formats: 'DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year', focusing on specific date patterns. The generated rule broadens this to any \"recognizable format\" like month/day/year or day/month/year, which covers similar patterns but is slightly more general and less precise. Both rules hinge on the presence of explicit date mentions, but the generated rule emphasizes \"explicit mention\" and \"recognizable format\" without specifying exact patterns, potentially allowing for more variations. Overall, they share the core concept of identifying explicit date mentions in recognizable formats, leading to similar classifications in most cases. The slight difference in specificity accounts for the score being less than perfect.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
