The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if it contains at least one word with a hyphen connecting two parts, exemplified by \"well-known.\" The Generated Rule similarly states that the output is True when the sentence contains a hyphenated compound adjective or modifier, providing multiple examples (\"well-known,\" \"state-of-the-art,\" \"high-quality,\" \"part-time\"). \n\nThe core concept—detecting hyphenated compounds—is consistent between the two rules. The main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of any hyphenated word, while the Generated Rule explicitly refers to hyphenated adjectives or modifiers, which are a subset of hyphenated words. However, in typical usage, the examples given in the Generated Rule align with the pattern described in the Ground Truth.\n\nThe slight difference in phrasing and scope (adjectives/modifiers vs. any hyphenated word) accounts for a small potential divergence, but in practice, they would produce the same classifications on most inputs involving hyphenated words.\n\nTherefore, they are nearly equivalent in intent and effect, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
