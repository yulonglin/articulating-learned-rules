The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule broadens this to include explicit indications of negative or problematic experiences or outcomes, with examples like cold, broken, disappointing, or unmet expectations. While the core concept—detecting negative or problematic mentions—is similar, the Generated Rule is somewhat more inclusive and less specific about explicit criticism, potentially capturing a wider range of negative indicators. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
