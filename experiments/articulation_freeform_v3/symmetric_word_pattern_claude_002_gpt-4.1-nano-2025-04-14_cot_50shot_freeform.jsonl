The Ground Truth rule explicitly states that the text must contain at least one palindrome word, which is straightforward. The Generated rule also emphasizes the presence of palindrome words (with examples) and additionally mentions references to symmetrical or reflective concepts, which could potentially include non-palindrome references. However, the core criterion—detecting at least one palindrome word—is consistent between them. The main difference is that the generated rule introduces a broader set of references (symmetry, reflection) that are not explicitly part of the ground truth, which could lead to slight divergence in edge cases. Overall, they largely describe the same logic, with the generated rule adding optional considerations. Therefore, they are very similar but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
