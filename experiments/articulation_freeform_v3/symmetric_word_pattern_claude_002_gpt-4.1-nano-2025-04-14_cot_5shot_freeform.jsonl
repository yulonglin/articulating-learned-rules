The ground truth rule emphasizes the presence of at least one palindrome word in the text, which aligns with the generated rule's core criterion. The generated rule explicitly states the condition and provides examples, but the fundamental pattern—identifying at least one palindrome word—is the same. The slight difference is that the ground truth rule is more general and less detailed, while the generated rule clarifies the context with examples and phrasing. Overall, they describe essentially the same classification logic, with only minor differences in presentation.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
