The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria to include various indicators of emotional intensity, such as multiple exclamation marks, exclamatory phrases, urgent language, and emotional reactions, and it also explicitly considers the tone as neutral or factual for False. While both rules recognize multiple exclamation marks as a key feature, the generated rule incorporates additional patterns and contextual cues beyond punctuation alone. Therefore, they overlap partially but are not fully aligned; the generated rule is more comprehensive and nuanced, leading to potential differences in classification for some inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
