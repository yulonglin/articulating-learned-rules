The Generated Rule broadens this to include sentences containing first-person pronouns that reflect personal reflection, decision-making, realization, or emotional introspection, but it explicitly states these are about the speaker's own experiences or thoughts.\n\nWhile both rules aim to detect first-person perspectives associated with internal, subjective states, the Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective's nature (personal reflection, realization, emotional introspection) explicitly about the speaker's internal experience. The Generated Rule is somewhat more general, mentioning \"personal reflection, decision-making, realization, or emotional introspection\" but also clarifies these are about the speaker's own experiences or thoughts.\n\nThey are largely aligned in identifying first-person, introspective, or subjective content, but the Ground Truth's focus on \"uses I, me, my, we, us\" and explicitly about internal reflection makes it slightly more specific. The Generated Rule could potentially include some sentences with first-person pronouns that are not necessarily reflective or introspective if they mention personal experiences but do not involve reflection or realization.\n\nOverall, they cover similar patterns and would likely produce similar classifications in most cases, but the Ground Truth's emphasis on the nature of the reflection and internal states makes their core concepts not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
