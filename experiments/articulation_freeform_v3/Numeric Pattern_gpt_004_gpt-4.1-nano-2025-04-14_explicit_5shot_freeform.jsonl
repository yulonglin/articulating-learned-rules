The generated rule broadly states that texts are positive if they contain any date or time-related detail indicating a factual or scheduled event, and negative if they lack explicit date/time references or are more general. While both rules hinge on the presence of date/time information, the generated rule is more general and less precise about the exact formats or patterns. It also emphasizes the context (factual/scheduled events vs. general ideas/opinions), which may lead to differences in classification, especially in ambiguous cases. Therefore, they share a core concept—using date/time references for classification—but differ significantly in specificity and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
