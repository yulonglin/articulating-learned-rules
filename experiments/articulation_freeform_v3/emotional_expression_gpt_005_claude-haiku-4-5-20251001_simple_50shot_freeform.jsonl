The Ground Truth emphasizes a \"clear emotional state\" explicitly, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include both explicit statements and implied reactions, and explicitly mentions \"strong emotion\" with examples like joy, sadness, frustration, excitement, or emotional pain.  \n\nThey share core concepts: detecting emotional expressions or states, and distinguishing them from neutral or factual situations. However, the Generated Rule introduces additional nuance by including physical or verbal reactions and explicitly states that emotions can be \"explicitly stated or clearly implied,\" which slightly broadens the scope compared to the Ground Truth's focus on conveying a \"clear emotional state.\"  \n\nMost inputs that depict clear emotional states will be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule might classify some ambiguous or implied emotional states as positive, whereas the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit conveyance. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical in scope and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
