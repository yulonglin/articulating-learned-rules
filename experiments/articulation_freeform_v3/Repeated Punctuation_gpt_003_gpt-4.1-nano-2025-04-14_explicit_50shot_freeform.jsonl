The ground truth emphasizes the presence of such a sequence anywhere in the text, and the generated rule explicitly states the same condition. The main difference is in phrasing: the generated rule mentions \"at least one sequence of three or more consecutive punctuation marks\" anywhere in the text, which aligns closely with the ground truth's description. \n\nThe only potential subtle difference is that the ground truth specifies \"a sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks,\" which could be interpreted as a sequence of the same character repeated three or more times, whereas the generated rule states \"three or more consecutive punctuation marks\"—which generally implies the same. Both rules are effectively capturing the same pattern.\n\nTherefore, they describe the same core pattern and would produce identical classifications in most cases, with only a very minor difference in wording.
