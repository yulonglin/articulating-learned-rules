The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on words like \"urgent,\" \"must,\" \"right away,\" \"today,\" and similar imperative language indicating time sensitivity. The Generated Rule explicitly defines the features (specific words and phrases) and clarifies that texts without such urgency are not included, which is consistent with the Ground Truth's description.\n\nHowever, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader, mentioning \"indicates an urgent request or call for immediate action\" without specifying particular words or patterns, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly lists certain keywords and phrases. This slight difference means that the Generated Rule might miss some expressions of urgency not containing the specified words, or include some borderline cases, whereas the Ground Truth could encompass a wider range of expressions.\n\nOverall, the core concept—identifying texts that demand immediate action—is the same, and they would likely produce similar classifications in most cases. The main difference is in the explicitness of features and potential coverage.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
