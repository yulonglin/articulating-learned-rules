The generated rule broadens this by classifying texts as positive if they contain multiple exclamation or question marks that convey strong emotion or emphasis, including sequences of four or more marks (e.g., '!!!!') and emphasizing emotional intent rather than strict pattern length.  \n\nWhile both rules target multiple exclamation or question marks, the ground truth emphasizes a specific pattern (three or more identical punctuation in a row), whereas the generated rule considers multiple marks as a sign of emphasis or emotion, which may include sequences longer than three or different contexts. Therefore, they share a core concept—multiple punctuation marks indicating emphasis—but differ in the precise pattern criteria and the emphasis on emotional conveyance versus pattern length.  \n\nThey would largely agree on texts with long sequences of identical punctuation, but may diverge on cases with multiple separate punctuation marks or shorter sequences. Overall, they are related but not perfectly aligned in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
