The generated rule, however, appears to specify that the pattern is based on double exclamation marks specifically at the end of the sentence, which is a narrower condition. While both rules involve exclamation marks, the ground truth emphasizes the count anywhere in the input, whereas the generated rule emphasizes their placement at the end. Therefore, they do not identify exactly the same features and would not always produce the same classifications, especially in cases where multiple exclamation marks are present but not at the end. The core concept of using exclamation marks is shared, but the specific pattern and criteria differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
