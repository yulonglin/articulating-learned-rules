The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, without specifying the exact terms or scope. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the text must reference financial, banking, economic, or investment-related concepts, policies, or entities, which is a broader set but overlaps significantly with the Ground Truth. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial and economic topics—and would likely produce the same classification on most inputs. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"economic\" concepts and \"policies\" or \"entities,\" which may lead to slight differences in classification for texts that mention these aspects but are not explicitly covered in the Ground Truth description. \n\nOverall, the core concepts are equivalent, and the rules are very similar in intent and scope, but the phrasing and explicit inclusion of additional terms in the Generated Rule account for a small difference in coverage.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
