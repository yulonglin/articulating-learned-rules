The Generated Rule emphasizes multiple punctuation marks used to convey strong emotion or emphasis, including examples like \"!!!\", \"???\", and \"...\", and notes their expressive function. While both rules recognize multiple punctuation marks as a key feature, the Ground Truth is more precise about the pattern (three or more identical marks), whereas the Generated Rule is broader, including different types of punctuation and their expressive intent.\n\nThey generally align in identifying texts with expressive punctuation, but the Generated Rule allows for a wider variety of patterns and purposes, potentially capturing cases not covered by the strict three-or-more identical punctuation criterion. Conversely, the Ground Truth rule is more specific about the pattern but less explicit about emotional or expressive intent.\n\nTherefore, they are similar in core concept—using punctuation to indicate emphasis or emotion—but differ in the exact patterns and emphasis, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
