It focuses solely on counting punctuation marks in the entire text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, centers on the presence of direct speech (dialogue) that includes certain punctuation marks—specifically semicolons, exclamation marks, or multiple punctuation types within quoted speech. It emphasizes the context of direct speech and the types of punctuation within it, rather than overall punctuation count.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their core features differ:  \n- The ground truth is a simple count-based rule applied to the entire text.  \n- The generated rule is context-dependent, focusing on dialogue and specific punctuation within it.\n\nThey may overlap in some cases (e.g., a text with multiple punctuation marks in dialogue might be classified similarly), but they are not equivalent in logic or scope. The generated rule introduces contextual considerations and specific punctuation within dialogue, which the ground truth rule does not account for.\n\nTherefore, they are only loosely related and do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
