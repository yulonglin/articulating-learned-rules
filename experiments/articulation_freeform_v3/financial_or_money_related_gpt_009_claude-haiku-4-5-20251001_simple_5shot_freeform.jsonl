The Ground Truth focuses specifically on finance, money, banking, or investments, while the Generated Rule broadens the scope to include legal and business topics, and explicitly mentions that the input should be about professional/financial matters. They share the core concept of identifying financial or business-related content, but the Generated Rule introduces additional categories (legal, business) and clarifies the context (professional/financial), which makes it slightly more inclusive. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying financial content but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
