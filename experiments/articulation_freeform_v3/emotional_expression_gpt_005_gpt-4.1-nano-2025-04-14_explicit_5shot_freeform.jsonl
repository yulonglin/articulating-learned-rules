The Ground Truth rule explicitly states that the text conveys a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the presence of identifiable emotions. The Generated rule broadens this to include \"intense, emotional, or vivid internal or external experiences or reactions,\" which captures similar emotional phenomena but emphasizes intensity and vividness, potentially including more nuanced or subjective experiences.  \n\nWhile the core concept of identifying emotional or experiential content is shared, the Generated rule's emphasis on intensity and vividness may lead to different classifications in borderline cases—either including more subtle emotional expressions or excluding some neutral but emotionally charged descriptions. Overall, they largely align in identifying emotionally significant content but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, resulting in a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
