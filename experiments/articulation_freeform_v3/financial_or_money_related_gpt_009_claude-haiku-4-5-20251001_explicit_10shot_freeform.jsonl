The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, without specifying particular terms. The Generated Rule explicitly lists financial topics and instruments, providing more detailed criteria. They largely overlap in identifying financial content as positive, and both exclude non-financial subjects. However, the Generated Rule's explicit mention of specific instruments, funds, markets, etc., may lead to slight differences in classification, especially for texts that are financial but do not mention these specifics, or texts that mention these specifics but are not primarily about finance. Therefore, they are very similar in core concept but not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
