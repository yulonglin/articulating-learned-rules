The Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective (first-person) and the subjective nature (personal experiences, realizations, reflections). The Generated Rule explicitly states that texts containing first-person perspective and describing personal actions or reflections are labeled True, while external observations or third-person narratives are labeled False. \n\nThe main difference lies in the phrasing and slight emphasis: the Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective and subjective involvement, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly mentions the content (personal experiences, actions, realizations, reflections) associated with that perspective. Despite this, the core concept—identifying first-person involvement and personal reflection—is consistent.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"describing personal experiences, actions, realizations, or reflections\" broadens the scope slightly beyond just perspective, potentially capturing some nuances not explicitly stated in the Ground Truth. Conversely, the Ground Truth's focus on perspective might be slightly more restrictive.\n\nOverall, they largely align in intent and key features, leading to a high equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
