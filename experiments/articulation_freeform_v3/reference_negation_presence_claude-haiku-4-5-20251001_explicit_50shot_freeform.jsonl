The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of negation words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never,\" regardless of other content, and classifies as negative if such words are present. The Generated rule similarly centers on negation or absence indicators, listing a broader set of negation words and phrases, and classifies as negative if such markers are present.  \n\nThe main difference lies in the scope and phrasing: the Ground Truth is more straightforward and broad, while the Generated rule explicitly lists additional negation expressions and emphasizes expressions of denial, refusal, or impossibility. Both rules would generally produce similar classifications on most inputs containing negation words, but the generated rule's broader list might lead to slightly more inclusive detection of negation.  \n\nOverall, the core concept—detecting negation or absence markers to classify as negative—is aligned, making them largely equivalent in intent and function, with minor differences in detail.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
