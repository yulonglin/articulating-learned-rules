The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of explicit negative language. The Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative experiences, complaints, or problems, and explicitly states that neutral or positive descriptions should be classified as false. While the phrasing differs—one emphasizes explicit dissatisfaction, the other emphasizes negative experiences—the core concept of detecting negative or problematic feedback is aligned. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"problem\" and \"disappointment,\" which may encompass some inputs not explicitly labeled as dissatisfaction in the Ground Truth. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying negative feedback, but the Generated Rule's broader scope accounts for a slightly wider range of negative expressions.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
