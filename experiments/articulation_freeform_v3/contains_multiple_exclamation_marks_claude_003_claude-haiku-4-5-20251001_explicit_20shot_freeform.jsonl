The ground truth explicitly states \"contains two or more exclamation marks,\" while the generated rule specifies \"contains two or more exclamation marks (!!),\" which is essentially the same pattern. The main difference is that the generated rule emphasizes \"high enthusiasm or emotional intensity,\" adding a qualitative interpretation, but this does not alter the core classification logic. They would produce identical results on most inputs, assuming the interpretation of \"!!\" as two exclamation marks. The slight difference in phrasing and added context accounts for a small deduction, but overall, they describe the same pattern.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
