The generated rule, however, broadly classifies texts as True if they contain numbers serving a concrete, factual, or quantitative purpose, and False if numbers are used metaphorically or descriptively. While both rules involve the presence of numbers, the ground truth emphasizes a specific pattern (exactly three consecutive digits), whereas the generated rule considers the function or context of the numbers (concrete vs. figurative). They overlap in that both recognize the importance of numbers, but the generated rule is more general and context-dependent, and does not restrict to a specific digit sequence length. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
