The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, directly targeting urgent language. The Generated Rule broadens this to any explicit emphasis on urgency, immediacy, or prompt action, and explicitly excludes routine, future, or non-urgent details. While the core concept of urgency is shared, the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"explicitly emphasize\" and the explicit exclusion criteria make it slightly more general and potentially broader in scope. Overall, they largely align in identifying urgent, immediate requests but differ slightly in phrasing and scope, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
