The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the explicit or implied emotional content. The Generated rule broadens this to include a range of strong emotional states and reactions, explicitly mentioning feelings like joy, sadness, anger, fear, excitement, overwhelm, etc., and also considers physical manifestations and emotional language. Both rules exclude neutral factual descriptions, focusing on emotional content.\n\nThe main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly lists more emotional states and emphasizes both explicit and implied expressions, while the Ground Truth rule is somewhat more general but essentially covers the same core concept. They are aligned in identifying emotional versus neutral content, with the generated rule being slightly more detailed and inclusive.\n\nOverall, they describe very similar classification logic, with minor differences in phrasing and scope, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
