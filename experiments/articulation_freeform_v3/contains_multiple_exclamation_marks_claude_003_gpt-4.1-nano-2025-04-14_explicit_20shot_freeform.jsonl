The generated rule states that a text is classified as True if it contains at least one exclamation mark or double exclamation marks, emphasizing the presence of either one or more exclamation marks, with an explicit mention of excitement or emphasis. While both rules involve exclamation marks, the ground truth requires at least two, whereas the generated rule considers one or more as sufficient. This difference means they will produce different classifications in cases where only a single exclamation mark is present. Therefore, they do not identify the same key pattern and are not equivalent in core concept, leading to a moderate discrepancy in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
