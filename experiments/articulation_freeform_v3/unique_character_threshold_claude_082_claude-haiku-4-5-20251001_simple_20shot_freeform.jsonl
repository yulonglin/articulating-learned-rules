In contrast, the generated rule classifies sentences based on their perceived simplicity or complexity, considering sentence length, structure, and language style. These criteria are quite different: one is a character count, the other is a qualitative assessment of sentence structure. They do not directly identify the same key features or patterns. While both aim to distinguish \"simple\" from \"complex\" texts, their methods and underlying concepts are not aligned, and they would likely produce different classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
