The ground truth emphasizes any sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks (e.g., '!!!', '???'), regardless of the specific punctuation type. The generated rule explicitly mentions sequences of three or more exclamation marks or question marks, which aligns with the core pattern. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly states \"at least one sequence\" and allows for other punctuation or words around the sequence, which does not alter the core pattern. Both rules focus on detecting sequences of three or more identical punctuation marks, making their classification logic effectively equivalent. The slight phrasing differences do not impact the core concept, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
