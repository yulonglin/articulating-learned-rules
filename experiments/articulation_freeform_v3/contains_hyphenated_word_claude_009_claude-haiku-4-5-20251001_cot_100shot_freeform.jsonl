It treats any hyphenated word as a trigger for labeling the input as True, regardless of context or type of hyphenation.  \n\nThe Generated Rule, however, specifies that classification as True occurs when the sentence contains hyphenated *compound adjectives* or *multi-word technical descriptors*, especially in professional or formal contexts. It also states that sentences with simple, non-hyphenated descriptive language or everyday observations are classified as False. This introduces a broader and more nuanced set of conditions, emphasizing the type of hyphenated words and their contextual usage, rather than just their presence.\n\nWhile both rules rely on hyphenation as a key feature, the generated rule incorporates additional considerations about the nature and context of hyphenated terms, making it more specific and less purely pattern-based. As a result, they would often agree on inputs with clear hyphenated words, but could diverge on cases where hyphenation is present but not in the specified contexts, or where the context matters.\n\nOverall, they share a core concept—hyphenation as a marker—but differ significantly in scope and emphasis, leading to a partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
