The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text is a polite, formal request or application, which captures the general intent. The Generated Rule specifies particular phrases and patterns (e.g., \"I request,\" \"Could you please,\" etc.) that are typical indicators of formal requests, providing concrete examples.\n\nThey share the core concept of recognizing formal, polite requests, but the Generated Rule is more explicit about specific linguistic cues, whereas the Ground Truth rule is more general. As a result, they would largely agree on most inputs involving explicit polite requests, but the Generated Rule might miss some formal requests that do not contain the specified phrases, and the Ground Truth rule might include some texts that are formal but do not contain the exact patterns listed.\n\nOverall, they are similar in intent and key features but differ slightly in specificity and scope, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
