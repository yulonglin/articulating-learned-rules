The Ground Truth specifies \"any negation words (like 'not', 'no', 'never') regardless of other content,\" focusing solely on the presence of negation terms. The Generated Rule broadens this by including \"negation or denial\" and adds more examples such as \"won't,\" \"doesn't,\" \"haven't,\" \"no longer,\" etc., which are also negation or denial expressions. \n\nThey largely identify the same key features—negation words—though the generated rule explicitly mentions additional negation forms and phrases, making it slightly more comprehensive. Both rules produce similar classifications on most inputs containing negation words, but the generated rule's inclusion of more variants could lead to minor differences in edge cases.\n\nOverall, the core concept—detecting negation to classify as negative—is aligned, making them quite similar, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
