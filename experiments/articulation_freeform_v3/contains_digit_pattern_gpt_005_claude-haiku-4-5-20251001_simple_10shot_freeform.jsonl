The Generated Rule broadly classifies inputs based on whether they contain numbers used for practical, quantifiable purposes versus those used for descriptive or poetic reasons, without specifying particular patterns or counts. While both rules involve the presence of numbers, the Ground Truth rule is pattern-specific, whereas the Generated Rule is more conceptual and contextual. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., inputs with exactly three digits used for counting), but generally, they do not describe the same classification logic and would often produce different outputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
