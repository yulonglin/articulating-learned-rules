It relies on detecting any palindromic word, making it flexible and broad in scope. The generated rule, however, classifies a sentence as True only if it contains the specific word \"racecar,\" which is a known palindrome. While both rules are based on the presence of a palindrome word, the generated rule is more restrictive, focusing solely on \"racecar\" and ignoring other possible palindromic words. Therefore, they share the core concept of palindrome detection but differ significantly in their implementation and scope, leading to different classifications in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
