The Ground Truth emphasizes the text being a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on politeness, formality, and the nature of the text as a request. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"appeal or inquiry\" asking for action or consideration, and explicitly classifies non-requests (statements of fact, personal experiences, general info) as False. \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying requests or appeals asking for action, but the Generated Rule explicitly includes inquiries and clarifies what is not a request, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly state. The core concept of recognizing polite requests or appeals is consistent, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.\n\nOverall, they describe similar classification logic with minor differences in detail and phrasing, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
