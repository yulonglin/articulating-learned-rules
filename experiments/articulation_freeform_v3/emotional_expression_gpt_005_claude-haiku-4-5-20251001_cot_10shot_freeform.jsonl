The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include feelings or emotional reactions, whether explicitly stated or implied through actions or expressions, and explicitly states that neutral factual or descriptive statements are not considered emotional. While the core concept—detecting emotional content—is aligned, the Generated Rule's inclusion of implied emotions and explicit negation for neutral statements introduces slight differences in scope. Overall, they largely overlap and would produce similar classifications, but the Generated Rule's broader phrasing accounts for some nuances not explicitly covered in the Ground Truth.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
