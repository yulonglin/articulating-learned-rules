The generated rule broadly describes repeated or elongated punctuation (e.g., multiple exclamation points or ellipses) suggesting emphasis or excitement, which may include but is not limited to sequences of three or more identical marks. It also mentions \"elongated\" punctuation, which could encompass non-consecutive or stylistic variations not captured by the strict repetition criterion. Therefore, while both rules aim to identify emphasis via punctuation, they differ in specificity and pattern focus. They would likely agree on many cases with clear repeated sequences but diverge on more nuanced or stylistic uses. Overall, they share a conceptual goal but differ in exact pattern detection, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
