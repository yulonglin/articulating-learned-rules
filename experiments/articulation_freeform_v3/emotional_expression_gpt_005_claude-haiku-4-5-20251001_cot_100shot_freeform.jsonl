The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any explicit description or indication of emotion, feeling, or emotional reaction, including physical manifestations or internal experiences, and explicitly states that neutral or factual descriptions are false. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting emotional content—is aligned, the Generated Rule's inclusion of physical manifestations and internal reactions slightly broadens the scope compared to the Ground Truth, which emphasizes \"conveys\" a clear emotional state. This could lead to minor differences in borderline cases. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying emotional expressions, making them quite similar, but not perfectly identical in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
