The ground truth emphasizes that all alphabetic characters are uppercase and that there is at least one letter, which aligns closely with the generated rule stating the text is written entirely in uppercase letters. The main difference is that the ground truth explicitly mentions the presence of at least one letter, whereas the generated rule implicitly assumes that if the text is entirely uppercase, it contains at least one letter (since uppercase letters are alphabetic). Therefore, they describe essentially the same classification logic, with minor phrasing differences, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
