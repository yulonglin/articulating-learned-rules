The Ground Truth specifies that all words must be entirely uppercase letters, which is a strict pattern. The Generated Rule considers inputs as True if they are in \"ALL CAPS (or predominantly uppercase),\" allowing for some flexibility or partial uppercase, and classifies normal sentence case or mixed case as False. While the core concept—using text formatting/capitalization to determine classification—is similar, the Ground Truth emphasizes a strict, word-by-word uppercase requirement, whereas the Generated Rule introduces a more lenient, style-based approach. Therefore, they largely align but differ slightly in strictness and interpretation, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
