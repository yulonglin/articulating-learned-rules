The Ground Truth specifies \"at least one word with a hyphen connecting two parts,\" which directly points to hyphenated words like \"well-known.\" The Generated Rule emphasizes hyphenated compound adjectives or multi-word phrases, which generally include hyphenated words used as adjectives or phrases. While the core concept—identifying hyphenated constructs—is aligned, the phrasing differs slightly: the Ground Truth is more general, simply requiring any hyphenated word, whereas the Generated Rule specifies certain types of hyphenated constructs (adjectives or phrases). They would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially straightforward cases, but the generated rule might exclude some hyphenated words not fitting the specified categories or include some multi-word phrases that are not strictly hyphenated words. Overall, the core concept is equivalent, but there is a slight difference in scope and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
