The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments. The Generated rule explicitly lists financial, banking, investment, economic, or monetary topics, including specific subcategories like policies, rates, markets, loans, savings, credit, funds, cryptocurrencies, etc. Both rules focus on financial content as the core feature.\n\nHowever, the Generated rule explicitly includes a broader set of financial-related topics and provides more detailed examples, which may lead to slightly more precise classification. The Ground Truth rule is somewhat more general, potentially allowing for some financial topics not explicitly listed in the generated rule, or vice versa.\n\nMost inputs discussing core financial themes will be classified similarly by both rules, making them largely equivalent in intent. The main difference is in the level of detail and explicitness, which accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
