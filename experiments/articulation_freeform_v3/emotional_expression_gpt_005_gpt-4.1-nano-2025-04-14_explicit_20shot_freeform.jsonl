The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of clear emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional expressions. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"genuine positive emotion, personal excitement, or internal feelings\" and explicitly states that neutral, factual, or external descriptions are labeled \"False.\" While the core concept of identifying emotional or personal sentiment is shared, the Generated Rule introduces additional qualifiers (\"genuine,\" \"internal feelings\") and explicitly excludes objective descriptions, which may lead to slight differences in classification. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying emotional content but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, making them similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
