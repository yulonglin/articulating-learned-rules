The Generated rule specifies that the classification depends on the presence of courteous phrases like \"please,\" \"may I,\" \"could you,\" etc., and relates to actions such as requesting, reviewing, or seeking approval. While both rules emphasize politeness and formality, the generated rule introduces specific keywords and contextual actions, making it more prescriptive.\n\nThey identify similar key features—politeness, formality, and request-like content—but the generated rule relies heavily on explicit phrases and specific actions, whereas the ground truth is more general. As a result, they would likely produce similar classifications in many cases but could diverge when polite requests lack the specified keywords or when formal requests are phrased differently. Therefore, they are related but not perfectly aligned in scope and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
