The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which is a broad conceptual focus. The Generated Rule specifies that the text contains urgent or critical language, listing specific keywords (\"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"immediately,\" etc.) and describing the need for immediate action. \n\nThey largely align in identifying urgency and immediate response as key features. However, the Ground Truth is more conceptual and less explicit about specific keywords, while the Generated Rule relies on particular words and phrases. This difference means that the generated rule might miss texts that imply urgency without using the listed keywords, or include texts with keywords that don't necessarily imply urgency in context.\n\nOverall, the core concept of detecting urgent, immediate action requests is consistent, but the explicit keyword-based approach introduces some divergence. Therefore, they are quite similar but not perfectly aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
