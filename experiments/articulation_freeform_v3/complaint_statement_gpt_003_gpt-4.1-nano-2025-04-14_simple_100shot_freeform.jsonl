The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit mentions of dissatisfaction or critique. The Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative or problematic experiences, issues, or failures, indicating complaints, and considers neutral or positive descriptions as non-issues. While the core concept of detecting dissatisfaction or problems is shared, the Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of a \"negative or problematic\" experience rather than explicitly mentioning dissatisfaction or criticism, which may include some subtle or less direct negative descriptions not captured by the Ground Truth. Overall, they largely align in identifying negative experiences but differ slightly in phrasing and scope, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
