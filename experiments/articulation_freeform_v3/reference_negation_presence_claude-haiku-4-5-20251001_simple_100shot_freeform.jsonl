The Ground Truth rule states that any negation word triggers a negative classification, regardless of other content. The Generated Rule explicitly lists negation and denial words, including additional variants like \"won't,\" \"don't,\" \"doesn't,\" \"couldn't,\" \"can't,\" \"no longer,\" and \"no way,\" which broadens the scope slightly. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting negation words—is consistent, the generated rule's inclusion of more negation forms and phrases makes it slightly more comprehensive. Both rules would generally produce similar classifications on most inputs containing these negation words. However, the ground truth rule's simplicity might miss some nuanced negations if they are phrased differently or if the list of negation words is not exhaustive.\n\nOverall, the core logic aligns well, but the generated rule's broader coverage and explicit listing make it slightly more detailed. Therefore, the equivalence is high but not perfect.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
