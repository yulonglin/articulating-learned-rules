The Ground Truth specifies that all alphabetic characters must be uppercase and that there must be at least one letter, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule stating the entire text must be in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. The main difference is that the Ground Truth explicitly mentions the presence of at least one letter, whereas the Generated Rule implicitly assumes that if the entire text is uppercase, it contains letters (unless the input is empty or non-alphabetic). Overall, they identify the same key feature—full uppercase text—and would produce very similar classifications on most inputs. The slight difference in explicitness accounts for a small potential divergence, but the core logic is effectively equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
