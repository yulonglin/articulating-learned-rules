The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on explicit indicators of urgency. The Generated Rule broadens this to include language indicating urgency, immediacy, or critical importance requiring prompt action, which aligns closely with the ground truth but allows for a slightly wider range of expressions. They would largely produce similar classifications, especially for clear cases of urgency, but the generated rule's broader phrasing might include some borderline cases not explicitly covered by the ground truth. Overall, the core concept of detecting urgent or immediate action requests is consistent, making them quite similar.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
