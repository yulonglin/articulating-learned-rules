The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the overall emotional content. The Generated Rule explicitly mentions emotional language, reactions, or states, including a broader set of emotions and related expressions, and clarifies that non-emotional descriptions (factual, neutral, physical) are negatives. While the phrasing differs—one is more concise and the other more detailed—they largely target the same core concept: detecting emotional content. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes a wider range of emotional expressions and clarifies what counts as non-emotional, which may lead to slight differences in classification. Overall, they are closely aligned in intent and pattern recognition, but the added detail in the Generated Rule accounts for a small divergence, hence a high score but not perfect.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
