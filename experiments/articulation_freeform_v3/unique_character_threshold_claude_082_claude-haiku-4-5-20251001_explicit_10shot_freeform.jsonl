In contrast, the generated rule emphasizes the simplicity of sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammatical features, without directly considering character count or complexity in terms of unique characters. While both rules aim to identify \"simple\" texts, their definitions of simplicity differ significantly. The ground truth could classify very short, simple sentences with many unique characters as \"simple,\" whereas the generated rule might classify longer, very short sentences with few words but complex vocabulary as \"not simple.\" Conversely, the generated rule might classify very short, simple sentences as true, regardless of character count, and vice versa. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, and their core concepts are only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9361702127659575,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":47,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":3,"accuracy":0.9361702127659575},"parse_error":false}
