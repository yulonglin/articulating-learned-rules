The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text conveys a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, which aligns with the core idea of expressing internal feelings. The Generated Rule explicitly states that true examples contain \"explicit expressions of strong emotions, feelings, or internal states,\" and false examples lack significant emotional content, emphasizing the internal versus external observation distinction.\n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one being more concise and the other more detailed—the core concept remains the same: the presence of notable emotional or internal states determines the label. They would generally produce similar classifications on most inputs, especially when emotional expression is explicit.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule's emphasis on \"explicit expressions\" and \"notable emotion\" might lead to slightly different judgments in borderline cases where emotional content is subtle or implied rather than explicit. Therefore, they are not perfectly identical but are very closely aligned.\n\nOverall, the core logic and key features identified are essentially the same, just articulated differently.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
