The ground truth emphasizes \"three or more identical punctuation marks,\" while the generated rule states \"at least one sequence of three or more consecutive punctuation marks,\" which is essentially the same criterion. The examples provided (\"!!!\", \"???\", \"...\") are consistent across both rules. The only minor difference is that the generated rule explicitly mentions \"at least one sequence,\" which clarifies the presence of such a sequence rather than just the existence of the pattern somewhere in the text. Overall, they describe the same core pattern and would produce identical classifications in most cases. The slight difference in phrasing does not affect the underlying logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
