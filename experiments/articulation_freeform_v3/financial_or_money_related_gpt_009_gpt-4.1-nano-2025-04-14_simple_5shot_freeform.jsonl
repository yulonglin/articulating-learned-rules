The Ground Truth specifies the topics explicitly, while the Generated rule emphasizes the presence of discussion related to financial or banking topics, with a straightforward True/False output. They identify similar key features—financial content—and would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs. However, the Ground Truth rule is slightly broader in scope, mentioning \"topics related to\" rather than \"discussion related to,\" which could lead to minor differences in borderline cases. Overall, their core concepts and patterns are very aligned, making them highly equivalent with a slight difference in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
