The Ground Truth emphasizes that all words consist entirely of uppercase letters, which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on text being written entirely in capital letters (ALL CAPS). The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly states that any text with standard capitalization, mixed case, or lowercase letters is False, implying a strict all-uppercase requirement. While the phrasing differs, the core concept—classification as True only when the entire text is uppercase—is effectively the same. Minor differences in wording and emphasis prevent a perfect score, but overall, they describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
