The Ground Truth specifies that all words must be \"entirely of uppercase letters,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's condition that the input is \"written entirely in UPPERCASE letters.\" Both rules ignore content or punctuation and focus solely on case. The main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes the words' composition, while the Generated Rule explicitly states the classification is based solely on text case, which is consistent with the Ground Truth. The slight difference in phrasing does not affect the core logic, making them nearly equivalent. The only reason for not assigning a perfect score is that the Ground Truth's wording could be interpreted as slightly more restrictive or specific, but practically, they implement the same classification.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
