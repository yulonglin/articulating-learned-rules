The generated rule, however, considers both the presence of double exclamation marks (\"!!\") and the expression of strong positive emotion or enthusiasm, which can include other textual cues beyond \"!!\". While \"!!\" is identified as a reliable indicator in the generated rule, it also accounts for emotional expressions that may not contain \"!!\". Therefore, they share some commonality regarding \"!!\" but differ significantly in scope and criteria, leading to potential discrepancies in classification.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
