The Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective and the personal nature of the statement, while the Generated Rule explicitly states that true statements contain first-person references and are about personal experiences, decisions, or actions. Both rules exclude third-party narratives and external observations. However, the Generated Rule introduces a broader criterion by including \"statements that contain a first-person perspective where the speaker is directly involved in or reflecting on a personal experience, decision, or action,\" which aligns with the Ground Truth's focus but adds a slight nuance about reflection and decision-making. Overall, they identify similar key features and would likely produce similar classifications, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
