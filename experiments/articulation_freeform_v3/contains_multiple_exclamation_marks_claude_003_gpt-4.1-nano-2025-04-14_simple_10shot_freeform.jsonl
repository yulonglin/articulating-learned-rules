The generated rule classifies inputs as True if there is at least one exclamation mark, regardless of how many, and False otherwise. While both rules rely on the presence of exclamation marks, they differ significantly in the threshold: the ground truth requires multiple marks, whereas the generated rule considers even a single mark as sufficient. Therefore, they do not identify the same key feature or pattern and would produce different classifications in many cases, especially for inputs with exactly one exclamation mark. The core concept of detecting exclamation marks is similar, but the criteria are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
