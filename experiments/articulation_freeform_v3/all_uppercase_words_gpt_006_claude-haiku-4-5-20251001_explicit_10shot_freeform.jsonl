The Ground Truth specifies that all words must be \"entirely of uppercase letters,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule stating the text is \"written entirely in UPPERCASE letters.\" They identify the same key feature: the presence of only uppercase characters throughout the text. \n\nHowever, the phrasing differs slightly: the Ground Truth emphasizes the composition of each word, while the Generated Rule broadly states the entire text is in uppercase, which generally implies all characters are uppercase. The core concept—checking for all uppercase characters—is equivalent, but the Ground Truth's focus on \"all words\" might imply a slightly stricter interpretation if, for example, punctuation or non-letter characters are involved. \n\nOverall, they produce the same classifications in most typical scenarios, making them effectively equivalent in intent and outcome, but with minor differences in phrasing and emphasis.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
