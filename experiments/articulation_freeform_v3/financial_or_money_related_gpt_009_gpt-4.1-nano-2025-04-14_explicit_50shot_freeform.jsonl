The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which is broad but clear. The Generated Rule explicitly states that a text is labeled True if it discusses or references financial concepts, banking, investments, or monetary instruments, aligning closely with the Ground Truth. The main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth uses general topic discussion, while the Generated Rule specifies \"discusses or references\" and includes \"monetary instruments,\" which is a slightly more detailed but still consistent criterion. They would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs, with minor potential differences in edge cases involving references rather than direct discussion. Overall, the core concepts and key features are equivalent, making them highly similar in logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
