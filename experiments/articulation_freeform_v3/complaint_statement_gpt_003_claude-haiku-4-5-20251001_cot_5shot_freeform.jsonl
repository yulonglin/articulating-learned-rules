The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text must \"explicitly state dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on clear expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule emphasizes detecting a \"specific complaint or negative experience with identifiable problems,\" which aligns with explicit criticism but also allows for some ambiguity if complaints are implied rather than directly stated. Both rules exclude neutral or non-criticizing content. While the phrasing differs, their core concepts—identifying negative, complaint-based statements—are largely aligned, leading to similar classifications in most cases. The slight difference in emphasis (explicit statement vs. specific complaint) accounts for the score being less than perfect.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
