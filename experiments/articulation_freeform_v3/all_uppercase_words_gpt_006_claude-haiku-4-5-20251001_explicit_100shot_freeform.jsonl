The ground truth specifies that every word must be entirely uppercase, which aligns with the generated rule's criterion of \"Text is in ALL CAPS.\" The generated rule explicitly states that any lowercase letters or mixed case results in False, matching the ground truth's requirement. The main difference is in phrasing: the ground truth emphasizes \"all words\" are uppercase, while the generated rule focuses on the entire text being in all caps. However, these are effectively equivalent in logic. The slight deduction is because the ground truth's wording could be interpreted as a word-level condition, whereas the generated rule applies to the entire text uniformly; but practically, they produce the same classification.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
