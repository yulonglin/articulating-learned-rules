The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, emphasizing the subject matter. The Generated rule provides a more detailed criterion, specifying that texts are labeled \"True\" if they explicitly mention or focus on financial activities, concepts, or entities, and \"False\" otherwise. While the core concept—identifying financial content—is shared, the generated rule emphasizes explicit mention and provides specific examples (investment, banking, market fluctuations, savings, tax regulations), which the ground truth rule does not explicitly specify. This could lead to slight differences in classification, especially in ambiguous cases. Overall, they describe similar logic but differ slightly in detail and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
