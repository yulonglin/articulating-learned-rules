The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text is a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on the tone (politeness, formality) and the nature of the act (request or application). The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"formal requests, inquiries, or applications\" directed toward a specific action or decision, and explicitly states that descriptive statements are false.\n\nWhile both rules target performative or transactional language versus descriptive language, the Ground Truth emphasizes politeness and formality, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the intent to request or apply. They largely overlap in identifying requests and applications as positive, and descriptions as negative, but the Ground Truth's focus on politeness and formality adds nuance that isn't explicitly captured in the generated rule.\n\nMost inputs that are polite, formal requests or applications will be classified similarly by both rules, but the generated rule might include some texts that are less formal or polite, which the ground truth might exclude. Conversely, the ground truth's emphasis on politeness and formality might exclude some texts that are transactional but not explicitly polite or formal.\n\nOverall, they describe similar core concepts but differ slightly in scope and emphasis, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
