The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text is a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on politeness and formality as key features. The Generated Rule broadens this to include inquiries and explicitly states that the output is True when the input is a formal request, application, or inquiry directed at someone to take action or make a decision, and False otherwise.\n\nWhile both rules target similar patterns—requests, applications, or inquiries—they differ slightly in scope and phrasing. The Ground Truth emphasizes politeness and formality, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly includes inquiries and clarifies the directionality (\"directed at someone\"). The core concept of requesting action or decision-making is consistent, but the phrasing and emphasis differ somewhat.\n\nMost inputs that are formal requests or applications would be classified similarly under both rules, but the Ground Truth might exclude some informal or less polite requests that the Generated Rule might include, and vice versa. Overall, they are closely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
