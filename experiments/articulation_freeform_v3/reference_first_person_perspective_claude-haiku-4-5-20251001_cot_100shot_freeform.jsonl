It emphasizes the perspective and the use of first-person pronouns. The Generated Rule also considers first-person pronouns but adds that the sentence must involve personal agency, reflection, or direct experience, and it classifies as True when these are present. It also specifies that external events, third-party actions, or objective facts without personal involvement lead to a False classification.\n\nWhile both rules focus on first-person perspective, the Generated Rule introduces additional criteria—personal agency, reflection, or direct experience—that are not explicitly mentioned in the Ground Truth. This could lead to differences in classification when a sentence contains first-person pronouns but lacks these additional elements.\n\nMost key features and patterns (use of first-person pronouns) are aligned, and they would likely produce similar classifications in many cases. However, the added nuance in the Generated Rule regarding agency and reflection makes it slightly more restrictive or specific, which could cause some divergence.\n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in core concept but differ slightly in scope and emphasis, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
