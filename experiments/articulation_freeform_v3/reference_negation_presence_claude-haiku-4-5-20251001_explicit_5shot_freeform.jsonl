It relies on explicit lexical cues indicating negation. The generated rule, however, focuses on the type of content—personal experiences, concerns, doubts, or unexpected events—regarding the speaker or subject, and distinguishes subjective or objective statements based on their nature. These two approaches are fundamentally different: one is lexically driven, the other content and context-driven. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would likely produce different classifications on many inputs. The core concepts are not equivalent; the ground truth rule is simpler and more lexical, while the generated rule is more semantic and content-based.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
