The Ground Truth rule emphasizes any word that reads the same forwards and backwards, regardless of specific words. The Generated rule specifies that the output is True when such a palindrome exists, often referencing common palindromic words like \"racecar,\" \"madam,\" etc., and implies a similar detection. While the generated rule adds contextual examples and slightly more detailed phrasing, the fundamental concept—identifying at least one palindrome word—is aligned. Minor differences in phrasing and emphasis on specific examples prevent a perfect score, but overall, they describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
