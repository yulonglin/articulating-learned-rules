The generated rule, however, focuses on the semantic content and style of the text—distinguishing between simple, imperative, or repetitive commands versus narrative or descriptive content—without any mention of character count. While both rules aim to separate \"simple\" or \"minimal\" texts from more complex ones, their criteria are fundamentally different: one is quantitative (character count), the other qualitative (semantic and stylistic features). They may occasionally overlap if simple commands happen to use very few characters, but generally, they do not identify the same patterns or features, and thus are not equivalent in logic or classification outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
