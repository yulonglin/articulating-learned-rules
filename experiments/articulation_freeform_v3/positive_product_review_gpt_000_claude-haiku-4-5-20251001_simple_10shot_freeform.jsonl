The Generated Rule emphasizes a **direct, personal positive experience or strong endorsement**, using specific words and phrases, and explicitly excludes neutral, negative, or secondhand reports.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify positive, experience-based endorsements of a product or service, the Generated Rule introduces more detailed criteria (e.g., specific words like \"love,\" \"blew me away\") and emphasizes the personal, direct nature of the experience. The Ground Truth is broader, simply requiring positive sentiment about the subject, regardless of whether it's personal or secondhand.\n\nMost inputs that are positive and personal will be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule might exclude some positive but less enthusiastic or less explicitly personal statements that the Ground Truth would include. Conversely, it might also exclude some positive statements that don't contain the specified keywords but still express positive sentiment.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of identifying positive opinions about a product or service, but the Generated Rule adds specificity that makes their classification criteria not perfectly aligned.\n\n**Final assessment:** The rules are related but not perfectly equivalent; they overlap significantly but differ in scope and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
