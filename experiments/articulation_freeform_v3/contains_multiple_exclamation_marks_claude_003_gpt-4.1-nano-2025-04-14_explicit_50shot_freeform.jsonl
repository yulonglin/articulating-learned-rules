The Ground Truth specifies \"contains two or more exclamation marks,\" which can be interpreted as at least two individual \"!\" characters anywhere in the text. The Generated Rule states \"at least one sequence of two or more consecutive exclamation marks,\" which is effectively the same criterion, since a sequence of two or more \"!\" characters implies at least two exclamation marks in total. The only subtle difference is that the generated rule emphasizes consecutive exclamation marks, whereas the ground truth could be interpreted as counting total exclamation marks regardless of adjacency. However, in typical interpretation, both rules identify the same key feature: the presence of at least two exclamation marks, whether consecutive or not. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in intent and would produce the same classifications in most cases. The slight difference in phrasing does not significantly alter the core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
