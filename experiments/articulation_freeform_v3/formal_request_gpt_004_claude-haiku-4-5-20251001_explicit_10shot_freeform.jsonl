The Ground Truth emphasizes the tone (\"polite, formal request or application\") and the nature of the text, while the Generated Rule explicitly defines true cases as containing formal requests, inquiries, or applications, and false cases as descriptive, casual, or general information requests. They share core concepts: formal, institutional requests versus casual or descriptive statements. \n\nHowever, the Ground Truth's focus on politeness and formality is somewhat broader and more qualitative, whereas the Generated Rule provides more explicit criteria about the content (requests, inquiries, applications) and excludes casual or general info. This slight difference in emphasis and phrasing accounts for the small gap in equivalence. Overall, they largely align in identifying the same key patterns, but the Ground Truth's emphasis on tone and the Generated Rule's explicit content criteria create minor differences.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
