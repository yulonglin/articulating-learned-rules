The Ground Truth emphasizes \"at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which aligns directly with the Generated Rule stating \"contains at least one palindrome.\" The examples provided in the Generated Rule clarify what counts as a palindrome, reinforcing the core concept. The main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth is more general, while the Generated Rule explicitly states the classification as True or False based on the presence or absence of such words. Overall, they identify the same key feature and would produce identical classifications in most cases, making them effectively equivalent in logic. The slight difference in wording prevents a perfect score, hence 9.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
