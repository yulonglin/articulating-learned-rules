The generated rule broadly considers emotional expression, decisive actions, or exclamations as indicators of True, and labels neutral/descriptive statements as False. While exclamations are a common feature in both, the generated rule encompasses a wider range of emotional or emphatic expressions beyond punctuation, and may classify inputs with strong emotion but fewer or no exclamation marks as True. Conversely, the ground truth rule strictly depends on punctuation count, regardless of emotional content. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns and would not produce identical classifications in many cases. The core concepts are related but not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
