The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the explicit mention of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of negative sentiment or evaluative language. The Generated Rule specifies that the text describes a negative experience or complaint, often with concrete problems, and clarifies that neutral or positive statements are not considered true. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting dissatisfaction or negative evaluation—is shared, the Ground Truth rule is broader and more general, simply requiring explicit mention of dissatisfaction or criticism. The Generated Rule adds detail by specifying the nature of negative experiences (e.g., specific problems) and explicitly excludes neutral or positive statements. \n\nMost inputs that express dissatisfaction explicitly will be classified similarly by both rules. However, the Generated Rule's emphasis on concrete problems and the exclusion of neutral/positive statements makes it slightly more specific. Overall, they align closely in intent and pattern recognition, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.\n\nTherefore, a high score of 8 reflects their strong conceptual overlap with minor differences in specificity and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
