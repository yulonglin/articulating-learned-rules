It does not consider the overall evaluative or qualitative nature of the descriptors, only the structural pattern of hyphenation.  \n\nThe generated rule, on the other hand, emphasizes the presence of evaluative, distinctive adjectives or phrases (like \"high-quality,\" \"well-known,\" \"mouth-watering\") as indicators of a True label. While \"well-known\" appears in both, the generated rule relies on the qualitative nature of descriptors rather than their hyphenation pattern.  \n\nTherefore, the two rules do not identify the same key features or patterns. The ground truth is pattern-based (hyphenation), whereas the generated rule is semantic (evaluative adjectives). They would not necessarily produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially if a text contains hyphenated words that are not evaluative or evaluative phrases that are not hyphenated.  \n\nOverall, the core concepts are different: one is structural (hyphenation), the other semantic (evaluative descriptors). Hence, the equivalence is minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
