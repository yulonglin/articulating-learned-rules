The generated rule, on the other hand, describes the nature of the sentence—whether it is a command, imperative, or short phrase—based on length and content characteristics. While both rules tend to select short, simple texts, they do so based on different features: one on character diversity, the other on sentence structure and intent. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ—texts with many unique characters but short length might be classified differently. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
