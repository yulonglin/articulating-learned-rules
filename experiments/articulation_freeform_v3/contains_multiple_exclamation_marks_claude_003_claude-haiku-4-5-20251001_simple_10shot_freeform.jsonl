The generated rule, however, describes a broader concept—detecting strong positive emotion, enthusiasm, or excitement—using exclamation marks (especially multiple ones) and emotionally charged language. While multiple exclamation marks are a common indicator in both, the generated rule also considers emotional language and general enthusiasm, which the ground truth rule does not explicitly include. Conversely, the ground truth rule does not account for emotional language beyond punctuation. Therefore, they share some overlap but are not fully aligned; the generated rule is more inclusive and interpretive, leading to potential differences in classification for inputs that are emotionally charged but lack multiple exclamation marks, or vice versa.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
