The generated rule, however, broadly considers emotional language, exclamation marks, and dramatic punctuation as indicators of heightened emotion, without specifying the exact pattern or number of punctuation marks. While both rules relate to punctuation and emotional tone, the ground truth is narrowly defined around a specific punctuation pattern, whereas the generated rule encompasses a wider range of emotional cues, including language and tone. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would often differ, especially in cases where emotional language is present without the specific punctuation pattern, or vice versa.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
