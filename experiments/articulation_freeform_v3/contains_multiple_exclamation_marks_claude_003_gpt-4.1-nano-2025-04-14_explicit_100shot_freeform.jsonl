It focuses solely on the count of exclamation marks.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of at least one exclamation mark immediately followed by another or by punctuation, suggesting emphasis or excitement, and also notes that multiple consecutive exclamation marks strongly indicate a True label. While it does mention multiple exclamation marks as a criterion, it introduces additional conditions about the position and context of exclamation marks that are not present in the ground truth rule.  \n\nTherefore, they share the core concept of multiple exclamation marks indicating a True label, but the generated rule adds more nuanced conditions that are not captured by the simple count-based ground truth rule. This means they are similar but not equivalent in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
