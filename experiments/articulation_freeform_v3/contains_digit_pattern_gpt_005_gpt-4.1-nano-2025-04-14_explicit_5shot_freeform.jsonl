The Generated Rule, however, broadly classifies texts as True if they contain any concrete factual detail (like a number or code) and False otherwise, without specifying the pattern or the exact nature of the factual detail. While both rules involve the presence of concrete factual content, the Ground Truth rule is pattern-specific (exactly three consecutive digits), whereas the Generated Rule is more general and conceptual. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs—particularly those with factual details that are not exactly three consecutive digits. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they would not produce the same classifications consistently.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
