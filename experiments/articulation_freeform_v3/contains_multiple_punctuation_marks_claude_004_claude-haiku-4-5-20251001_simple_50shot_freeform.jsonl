It focuses solely on the count and presence of these punctuation marks, regardless of their context or the nature of the text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, describes a more complex and interpretive pattern. It considers the presence of multiple independent clauses or sentences connected by punctuation that creates a sense of dialogue, exclamation, contrast, or conversational flow—often involving quoted speech, rhetorical questions, or emphatic expressions. It emphasizes the function and effect of punctuation rather than just counting them.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, the ground truth rule is purely quantitative and straightforward, whereas the generated rule is qualitative and context-dependent. They may overlap in cases where multiple punctuation marks indicate complexity, but the generated rule could classify texts as True based on their conversational or expressive style even if they contain fewer than three punctuation marks, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications would only partially overlap.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
