The Ground Truth specifies two exact formats ('DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year') as indicators for positive classification. The Generated Rule broadens this by including formats like 'MM/DD/YYYY' and mentions \"a month and day with a year,\" which covers additional date formats. Both rules consider explicit date mentions as positive signals, but the generated rule also encompasses references to specific time-related events (e.g., birth date, holiday), which are not explicitly included in the ground truth. While the core concept—identifying explicit date mentions—is aligned, the generated rule is somewhat more inclusive and less precise about the exact formats. Therefore, they are similar in intent but differ slightly in scope and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
