The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which is a broad but clear focus on urgency and immediacy. The Generated Rule explicitly lists specific keywords (\"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" \"critical,\" \"emergency,\" \"now,\" \"without delay\") and mentions describing a crisis situation requiring prompt response, aligning closely with the core concept of urgency and immediacy.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule introduces a more detailed set of keywords and explicitly includes crisis situations, which the Ground Truth does not specify explicitly. The Ground Truth is somewhat more general, while the Generated Rule provides concrete indicators.\n\nMost inputs that indicate urgency or immediate action would be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule might classify some statements as urgent based on keywords that the Ground Truth might not explicitly consider, and vice versa.\n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying urgent, immediate action requests is well-aligned, but the phrasing and specific criteria differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
