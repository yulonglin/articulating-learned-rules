The Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective and the subjective nature of the statement, while the Generated rule explicitly states the presence of first-person pronouns and their reflection of personal involvement.  \n\nHowever, the Ground Truth specifies that the perspective is \"written from first-person perspective\" and involves \"personal experience, decision-making, or introspection,\" whereas the Generated rule broadens this to any sentence containing first-person pronouns that reflect personal involvement, without explicitly mentioning the nature of the involvement (experience, decision, introspection). Additionally, the Generated rule considers external events or observations as false, aligning with the idea that only personal involvement counts, but it may be slightly less precise in capturing the nuance of \"reflection\" or \"internal states\" emphasized in the Ground Truth.\n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying first-person perspective as the key feature, and would likely produce similar classifications in most cases. The main difference is in the phrasing and slight emphasis on the nature of the reflection or internal involvement, which accounts for the slight deduction.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
