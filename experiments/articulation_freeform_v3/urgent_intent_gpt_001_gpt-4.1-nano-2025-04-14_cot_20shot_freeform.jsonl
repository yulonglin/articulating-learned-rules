The Ground Truth emphasizes the overall indication of urgency or immediate action in the text, while the Generated rule specifies key words and phrases (\"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" \"right away,\" \"critical\") as indicators, and notes the absence of such language in non-urgent cases. They largely identify the same core feature—urgency signaling—though the Ground Truth is more general, and the Generated rule provides specific lexical cues. As a result, they would likely produce very similar classifications, with minor differences possible in edge cases where urgency is implied but not explicitly marked by the specified keywords.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
