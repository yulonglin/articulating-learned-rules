The ground truth specifies \"all alphabetic characters are uppercase and there is at least one letter,\" which aligns closely with the generated rule stating \"Text is entirely in UPPERCASE letters (all words composed of capital letters only).\" The generated rule's \"False\" condition—containing any lowercase letters or mixed case—matches the ground truth's requirement of not having lowercase letters and having at least one letter. The only minor difference is that the ground truth explicitly emphasizes the presence of at least one letter, whereas the generated rule implies it by requiring all characters to be uppercase letters. Overall, they describe the same core pattern with very slight phrasing differences, leading to a high equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
