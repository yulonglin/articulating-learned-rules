It is precise and strict about the length being exactly three.\n\nThe generated rule, however, considers sequences of **3 or more consecutive digits**, which broadens the criterion to include sequences of length 3, 4, 5, etc. Additionally, it emphasizes that the sequence appears to be used as a meaningful number in context, which introduces an interpretive element not present in the ground truth. It also excludes sequences that are part of standard formatting (like email addresses or phone numbers), which adds complexity beyond the simple pattern matching.\n\nWhile both rules focus on digit sequences, the generated rule's allowance for longer sequences and contextual interpretation means they do not perfectly align. They agree on some cases (e.g., exactly three digits), but differ when longer sequences are involved or when context is considered.\n\nTherefore, they are similar but not equivalent, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
