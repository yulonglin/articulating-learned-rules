The generated rule classifies an input as True solely based on the presence of at least one exclamation mark, and classifies as False if none are present. These rules differ significantly in key features: the ground truth emphasizes the quantity and variety of punctuation, while the generated rule focuses only on exclamation marks and ignores other punctuation. They would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs, especially those with multiple punctuation marks but no exclamation marks, or with exclamation marks but fewer than three total punctuation marks. The core concepts are not equivalent, as one considers the number and types of punctuation, and the other centers solely on exclamation marks.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
