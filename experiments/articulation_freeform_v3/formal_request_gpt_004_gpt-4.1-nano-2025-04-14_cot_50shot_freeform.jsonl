In contrast, False examples are generally neutral, descriptive statements, or casual questions that do not involve formal requests or polite phrasing. \n\nRule: The input is labeled True if it contains a polite, formal request or inquiry using courteous language, indicating a request for assistance, approval, or information; otherwise, it is labeled False.","keyword_match_score":0.75,"rouge_l_score":0.35897435897435903,"llm_judge_score":0.7,"llm_judge_reasoning":"Both rules aim to identify polite, formal requests or applications. The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text is a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on the nature of the text itself. The Generated Rule specifies that the input is labeled True if it \"contains a polite, formal request or inquiry using courteous language,\" which aligns with the core concept of identifying requests made politely and formally. However, the Generated Rule also explicitly mentions \"indicating a request for assistance, approval, or information,\" adding a slightly broader scope that includes inquiries and requests for help, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly specify. Additionally, the Ground Truth describes the text as a \"request or application,\" which may encompass a broader range of formal documents beyond just requests or inquiries. Overall, they share the core concept of recognizing polite, formal requests, but the Generated Rule's inclusion of inquiries and its emphasis on courteous language introduces some differences. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
