The Ground Truth explicitly states that the input is labeled True if it contains at least one hyphen-connected word, which is a straightforward pattern. The Generated Rule broadens this by including multi-word descriptive phrases (e.g., \"beautifully crafted\") and explicitly mentions multi-word descriptors, which can also serve as indicators of descriptive compounds.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule introduces additional nuance by considering multi-word phrases and explicitly excluding simple adjectives and temporal language from the True classification, aligning with the core idea of identifying descriptive modifiers. It also emphasizes the function of these phrases as adjectives, which is consistent with the Ground Truth's focus on hyphenated words.\n\nThe main divergence is that the Ground Truth's criterion is solely based on the presence of hyphenated words, while the Generated Rule considers a broader set of multi-word descriptors and explicitly excludes certain non-relevant language. This means they will generally agree when the input contains hyphenated adjectives, but the Generated Rule might classify some multi-word descriptors as True even if they are not hyphenated, and vice versa.\n\nOverall, the core concept—identifying descriptive modifiers—is aligned, but the scope and specific patterns differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9387755102040817,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.9387755102040817},"parse_error":false}
