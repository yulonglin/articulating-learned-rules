It implies a focus on these exact formats and does not mention other date formats or vague temporal references.\n\nThe generated rule broadens the scope significantly by including any date in any format (e.g., 'MM/DD/YYYY', 'Month Day, Year', etc.) and explicitly states that it considers all dates regardless of validity. It also explicitly excludes vague temporal references, which the ground truth rule does not address.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify date mentions, the generated rule is more inclusive and less precise about the specific formats, and it explicitly excludes vague references, which the ground truth does not specify. Therefore, they are similar in intent but differ in the details and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of detecting date mentions but differ in the exact formats and scope, resulting in a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
