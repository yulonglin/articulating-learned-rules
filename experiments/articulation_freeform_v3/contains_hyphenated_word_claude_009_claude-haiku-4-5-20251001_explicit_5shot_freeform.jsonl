In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of references to imitation, adoption, or replication, which are conceptual ideas unrelated to hyphenation. These rules do not identify the same features or patterns; they would rarely produce the same classifications, as one is pattern-based and the other is concept-based.
