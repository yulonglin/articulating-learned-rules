The Ground Truth emphasizes \"reads the same forwards and backwards\" and \"at least one word,\" while the Generated Rule explicitly states the output is True when such a word exists, providing examples like \"kayak,\" \"racecar,\" or \"madam.\" The core concept—detecting at least one palindrome word—is consistent. The slight difference is that the Ground Truth is phrased more generally, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly states the output condition and examples, but these do not significantly alter the underlying logic. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in classification criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
