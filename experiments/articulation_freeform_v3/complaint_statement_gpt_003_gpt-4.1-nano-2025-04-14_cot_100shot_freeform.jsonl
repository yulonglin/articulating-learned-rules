The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text must mention dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit negative language. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any description of a negative experience, dissatisfaction, or problem related to quality, service, or conditions, which may encompass more implicit or less direct expressions. While they largely overlap in identifying negative feedback, the generated rule's inclusion of \"problem related to quality, service, or conditions\" introduces a slightly broader scope that could lead to differences in classification, especially in cases where negativity is implied rather than explicitly stated. Overall, they share core concepts but differ slightly in phrasing and scope, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
