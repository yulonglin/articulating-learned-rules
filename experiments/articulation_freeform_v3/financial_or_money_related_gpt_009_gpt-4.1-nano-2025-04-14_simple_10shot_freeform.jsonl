The Ground Truth Rule broadly states that the text discusses finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated Rule specifies that the output is True when the sentence explicitly mentions or discusses financial activities, concepts, or terminology related to banking, investing, or finance, and False otherwise. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial content and terminology—and would generally produce the same classification on most inputs. However, the Ground Truth is slightly broader, potentially including implicit or contextual references to finance, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes explicit mentions. This subtle difference means they are not perfectly aligned, but their core concepts and patterns are very similar, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
