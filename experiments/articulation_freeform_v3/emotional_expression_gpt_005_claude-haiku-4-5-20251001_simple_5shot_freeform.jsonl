The generated rule emphasizes the presence of strong emotional language or vivid descriptive words that convey intense feelings, including both positive and negative emotions, and provides specific examples. While both rules aim to identify emotional content, the generated rule is broader in scope, capturing intense language that may not explicitly state an emotional state but implies one through descriptive words. Conversely, the ground truth rule centers on explicit emotional states rather than the intensity of language. Therefore, they overlap in identifying emotional content but differ in their focus—one on explicit emotional states, the other on emotionally charged language—leading to partial but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
