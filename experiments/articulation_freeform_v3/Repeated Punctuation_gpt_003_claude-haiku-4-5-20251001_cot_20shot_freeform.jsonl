I never expected this to happen.\" - has ellipsis\n- \"The weather has been terrible lately!!!\" - has exclamation marks\n- \"The answer is quite simple...\" - has ellipsis\n- \"Are you serious????\" - has multiple question marks\n- \"I can't believe you did that!!! Did you really?\" - has exclamation marks and question marks\n- \"I can't believe it!!! But I guess so.\" - has exclamation marks\n- \"It's been a long day... I need a break!!!\" - has ellipsis and exclamation marks\n\n**False cases:**\n- All contain standard punctuation (periods, commas) or no emphatic punctuation\n- They are factual, neutral statements without emotional intensity markers\n\n**Pattern identified:**\nThe True cases all contain emphatic or expressive punctuation marks (ellipsis \"...\", multiple or repeated exclamation marks \"!!!\", or multiple question marks \"???\"), while False cases use only standard punctuation.\n\n# Rule:\n\n**Classify as True if the text contains emphatic punctuation marks such as ellipsis (...), multiple exclamation marks (!!!), or multiple question marks (???).

The generated rule broadens this by including emphatic punctuation such as ellipsis (...) and explicitly mentions multiple exclamation or question marks, but it also introduces the concept of \"standard punctuation\" as a negative indicator, which is less precise.  \n\nWhile both rules aim to identify emphatic or expressive punctuation, the ground truth emphasizes repeated identical marks of length three or more, whereas the generated rule considers certain punctuation marks (ellipsis, multiple exclamation/question marks) as indicators of emphasis, but does not specify the length or exact pattern. This difference means they may diverge in classification for some inputs—e.g., a text with two exclamation marks ('!!') would be negative under the ground truth but positive under the generated rule if it considers multiple exclamation marks as emphatic.  \n\nOverall, they share a core concept of identifying expressive punctuation, but the specific patterns and criteria differ, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
