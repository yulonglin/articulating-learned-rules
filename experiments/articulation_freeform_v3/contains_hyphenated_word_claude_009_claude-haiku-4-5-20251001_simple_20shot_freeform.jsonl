It does not specify the role of the hyphenated word beyond its existence.\n\nThe Generated Rule broadens this by defining the presence of a compound adjective—either hyphenated or multi-word descriptors—that modifies a noun, including examples like \"well-known,\" \"high-quality,\" \"state-of-the-art,\" etc. It emphasizes the function of the phrase as a modifier, not just the hyphenation itself.\n\nWhile both rules rely on hyphenated words as a key feature, the Generated Rule incorporates additional types of complex descriptors (multi-word phrases) and their modifying role, which the Ground Truth Rule does not explicitly mention. Therefore, they are similar but not identical in scope.\n\nMost inputs containing hyphenated words that serve as modifiers will be classified similarly, but the Generated Rule may classify some sentences as True based on multi-word descriptors that the Ground Truth Rule would not recognize if they lack hyphens. Conversely, the Ground Truth Rule might classify sentences as True solely based on hyphenation, even if the hyphenated word isn't functioning as a modifier.\n\nOverall, they are related but not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
