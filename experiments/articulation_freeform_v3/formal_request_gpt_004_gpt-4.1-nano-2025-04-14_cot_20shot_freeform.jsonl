The Generated rule specifies that true cases are requests or polite inquiries explicitly asking for assistance, permission, or action, often with words like \"please,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" or \"may,\" and focus on seeking approval or information. False cases are non-request statements or factual questions.\n\nWhile both rules center on requests and politeness, the Ground Truth emphasizes the overall tone and formality, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes explicit request words and the intent to seek permission or help. They largely overlap but differ in scope: the Ground Truth is broader, potentially including polite applications that may not explicitly contain request words, and the Generated rule is more specific about explicit language and intent.\n\nTherefore, they are similar in core concept but not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
