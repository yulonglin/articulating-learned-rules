The generated rule, however, considers a broader set of emotional expressions—gratitude, positive feelings, personal struggles—often marked by exclamation marks, but not exclusively so. It also emphasizes the nature of the statement (expressive vs. neutral/informational), not just punctuation. While both rules recognize exclamation marks as a key feature, the generated rule incorporates additional contextual and emotional cues, making their core criteria only partially aligned. Therefore, they are somewhat related but not equivalent in logic or scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
