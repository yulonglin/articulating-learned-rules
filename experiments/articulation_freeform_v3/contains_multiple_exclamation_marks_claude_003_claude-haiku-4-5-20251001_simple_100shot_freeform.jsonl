The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria to include strong emotional expression, urgency, or excitement conveyed through multiple exclamation marks (2+), as well as emphatic language or shouted speech, and explicitly states that neutral or calm statements are False regardless of punctuation. While both rules recognize multiple exclamation marks as a signal for excitement or emphasis, the generated rule incorporates additional cues (emphatic language, shouted speech) and explicitly excludes neutral statements, making it more inclusive and nuanced. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
