The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional states. The Generated rule broadens this to include explicit emotional language or strong emotional states, positive or negative, and excludes neutral or purely descriptive content. While they largely overlap in identifying emotional content, the Generated rule explicitly mentions \"explicit emotional language\" and \"strong emotional states,\" which may include more subtle or implicit emotions not captured by the Ground Truth. Conversely, the Ground Truth emphasizes the conveyance of a clear emotional state, which might be slightly narrower. Overall, they share core concepts but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
