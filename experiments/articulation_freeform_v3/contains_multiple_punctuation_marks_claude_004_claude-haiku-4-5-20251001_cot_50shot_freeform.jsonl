Did you see that? The fireworks were incredible; I couldn't believe it.\"\n- Exclamatory or emphatic language combined with other punctuation: \"Can you believe she said that?! I was stunned.\"\n- Conversational elements with varied punctuation: \"What time is the meeting? Should we bring snacks, or do they provide them?\"\n- Interjections or emotional expressions: \"Well... I wasn't sure; however, it might work out.\"\n\n**The Pattern:**\nThe True cases contain **multiple distinct punctuation marks** (especially combinations like semicolons with exclamation marks, question marks with exclamation marks, or quoted speech with varied punctuation), **direct dialogue**, or **emphatic/conversational tone markers** that create structural complexity. False cases are simpler, more straightforward statements with minimal punctuation variety.\n\n# Rule\n\n**True if the text contains multiple distinct punctuation marks (such as semicolons, exclamation marks, and question marks in combination), direct quoted speech, or emphatic interjections that create structural or tonal complexity; False if it's a simple, straightforward statement with minimal punctuation variety.**","keyword_match_score":0.5,"rouge_l_score":0.16949152542372883,"llm_judge_score":0.4,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule explicitly classifies an input as True if it contains three or more punctuation marks from a specific set {. , ! ? ; :}. It relies solely on the count and presence of these punctuation marks, regardless of their context or the overall structure of the text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, describes a more complex set of conditions: it considers multiple distinct punctuation marks in combination, as well as structural features like quoted speech and emphatic interjections that create tonal or structural complexity. It also classifies simple statements with minimal punctuation as False. This introduces qualitative aspects (e.g., tonal complexity, speech quotes) that are not explicitly part of the ground truth rule.\n\nWhile there is some overlap—both rules recognize that multiple punctuation marks or structural complexity can indicate a certain classification—the generated rule's criteria are broader and more nuanced. It emphasizes the nature and context of punctuation rather than just the count, which can lead to different classifications on some inputs.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent in their logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
