The Ground Truth Rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, without specifying particular aspects. The Generated Rule expands on this by explicitly including advice, products, regulations, or market operations within the financial domain, and clarifies that non-financial subjects like nature, hobbies, art, or general life events should be classified as False.\n\nThey identify the same key features—financial topics—though the Generated Rule provides more detailed scope and examples. Most inputs discussing core financial topics would be classified similarly under both rules. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions certain subcategories and clarifies what is outside the scope, which the Ground Truth does not. Despite this, the core conceptual focus remains aligned.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in intent and general classification logic, but the Generated Rule is slightly more detailed and explicit, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
