The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated rule specifies that true examples relate to financial activities, concepts, or terminology, and false examples are unrelated topics. The core pattern—identifying whether the content pertains to finance—is consistent.  \n\nHowever, the Generated rule explicitly mentions specific examples (investment, banking, market fluctuations, saving, tax regulations) and clarifies that unrelated topics are outside the scope. The Ground Truth rule is slightly more general, not listing specific examples but implying a broader thematic coverage. Despite this, the core concept—classification based on financial relevance—is aligned.  \n\nTherefore, they largely identify the same key features and would produce similar classifications, with minor differences in phrasing and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
