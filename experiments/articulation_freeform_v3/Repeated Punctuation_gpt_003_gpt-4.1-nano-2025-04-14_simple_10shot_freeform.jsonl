The ground truth specifies \"three or more identical punctuation marks,\" which is precise and quantitative. The generated rule mentions \"multiple consecutive punctuation marks\" and examples like \"!!!\" or \"...\", implying at least two or more, but emphasizes emphasis or excitement rather than a strict count. While both rules target similar patterns, the generated rule is slightly less precise in terms of the minimum number of punctuation marks and introduces a broader interpretation (\"indicating emphasis or excitement\"). Therefore, they largely overlap in identifying the key feature but differ slightly in specificity and nuance, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
