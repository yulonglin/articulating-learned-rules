The generated rule, however, states that the input should be classified as True if it contains \"a sequence of exactly 3\" without specifying what the sequence pertains to—digits, characters, or any other pattern. This ambiguity means the generated rule does not explicitly identify the same key feature (three consecutive digits). While both mention \"exactly three,\" the lack of context in the generated rule makes it unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, especially if the input contains other types of sequences. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or pattern identification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
