In contrast, the generated rule classifies based on sentence length, simplicity, and presence of specific types of language (commands, greetings, basic statements), which are content and style-based features. These criteria are quite different: one is a quantitative character count, the other is qualitative assessment of sentence complexity and style. While very short texts with few characters might often be simple and command-like, the rules do not directly align in identifying the same patterns or features. Therefore, they are largely different in their classification logic and would rarely produce identical outputs on the same inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
