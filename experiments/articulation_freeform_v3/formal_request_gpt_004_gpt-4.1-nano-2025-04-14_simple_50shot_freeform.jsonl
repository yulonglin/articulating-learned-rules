The Generated rule specifies that the output is True when certain polite, formal phrases like \"could you kindly\" or \"I kindly request\" are present, and False otherwise. While both rules aim to identify polite, formal requests, the Ground Truth emphasizes the general nature of the request or application, whereas the Generated rule relies on specific phrase patterns. They often overlap but are not fully aligned: the Ground Truth may include formal requests that do not contain the exact phrases specified in the Generated rule, and the Generated rule may produce True for texts with those phrases even if the overall context isn't a request or application. Therefore, they share core concepts but differ in pattern specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
