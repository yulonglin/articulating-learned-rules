The Generated Rule broadens this to include any explicit mention or reference to a date or time, encompassing various formats and possibly more general references. While both rules hinge on the presence of date-related information, the Ground Truth is more precise about the formats, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes explicit mention or reference, which could include a wider range of expressions. They would largely agree on most inputs containing clearly formatted dates, but the Generated Rule might classify some inputs as positive that the Ground Truth would not (if the date isn't in the specified formats). Conversely, the Ground Truth might classify some inputs as positive based solely on the specified formats, even if the mention is implicit or not explicitly referenced. Overall, they share the core concept of identifying date references but differ in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
