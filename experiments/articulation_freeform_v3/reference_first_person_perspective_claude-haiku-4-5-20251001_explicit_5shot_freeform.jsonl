The Ground Truth emphasizes first-person perspective and personal agency (\"I, me, my, we, us\"), focusing on the speaker's direct involvement. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"statements that describe personal plans, possessions, or experiences involving the speaker/writer or their immediate circle,\" which aligns with the idea of personal or subjective involvement but introduces the concept of \"immediate circle\" and specific types of statements (plans, possessions, experiences). \n\nBoth rules distinguish between subjective/personal content and objective/external facts. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly mentions plans, possessions, and experiences, which are specific types of personal involvement, whereas the ground truth emphasizes perspective and first-person pronouns. \n\nIn most cases, they would produce similar classifications, especially for statements clearly involving personal perspective or agency. However, the generated rule might classify some statements involving the immediate circle or possessions as \"True\" even if they are not explicitly from a first-person perspective, which could differ from the ground truth's strict focus on first-person pronouns.\n\nOverall, the core concept of distinguishing subjective/personal involvement from objective/external facts is aligned, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
