In contrast, the generated rule describes a broader conceptual distinction based on human intentionality and aesthetic choices versus purely descriptive observations. These two rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; the ground truth is based on a specific textual feature, while the generated rule relies on semantic and contextual interpretation. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as the criteria are fundamentally different. The core concepts are not equivalent—one is a syntactic pattern, the other a semantic and pragmatic distinction—so their equivalence is minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
