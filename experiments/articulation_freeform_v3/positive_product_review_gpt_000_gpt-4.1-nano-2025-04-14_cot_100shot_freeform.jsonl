The Generated rule broadens this to include any positive effect, usefulness, or personal improvement related to a product, service, or experience, which may encompass a wider range of statements, including neutral or informational mentions of benefits. While both rules aim to identify positive evaluations related to products or services, the Ground Truth emphasizes sentiment explicitly, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes positive effects or improvements, which may not always be expressed as sentiment. Therefore, they share some core concepts but differ in scope and focus, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
