The generated rule broadly states that the input contains \"a specific date or date-related information,\" which could encompass various date formats, references, or related terms, not necessarily limited to the exact formats specified. While both rules aim to identify date-related content, the generated rule is more general and less precise about the patterns. They would likely agree on many inputs containing explicit dates in the specified formats, but the generated rule might also classify inputs with more vague or indirect date references as positive, leading to some divergence. Overall, they share the core concept of detecting date information but differ in specificity and pattern recognition.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
