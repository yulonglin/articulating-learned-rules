The generated rule allows numbers and punctuation as long as the input is uppercase, which aligns with the ground truth's focus on uppercase alphabetic characters, provided that the input contains only uppercase letters (and possibly numbers/punctuation). The key difference is that the ground truth explicitly states the presence of at least one letter, whereas the generated rule implicitly assumes that if the input is all uppercase (and may include numbers/punctuation), it is acceptable, but it does not explicitly require at least one letter. Overall, they identify similar patterns and would produce the same classification on most inputs, especially those with only alphabetic characters. The core concept—uppercase letters indicating True—is consistent, making them largely equivalent in intent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
