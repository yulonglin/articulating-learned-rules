The Ground Truth emphasizes that the text indicates an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the content's intent. The Generated Rule specifies that the output is **True** when the message conveys urgency, criticality, or immediate need, using specific keywords like \"urgent,\" \"critical,\" \"immediately,\" etc., and **False** for routine or casual messages.  \n\nWhile the core concept of detecting urgency is shared, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader, emphasizing the overall indication of urgency or immediate action without explicitly listing keywords. The Generated Rule explicitly mentions certain words and provides a more detailed criterion for classification.  \n\nMost inputs that clearly indicate urgency with keywords or context would be classified similarly by both rules. However, the Ground Truth might also include messages implying urgency without explicit keywords, which the Generated Rule might miss if those keywords are absent. Conversely, the Generated Rule's reliance on specific words might lead to different classifications in some edge cases.  \n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in intent and general pattern recognition but differ slightly in scope and explicitness.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
