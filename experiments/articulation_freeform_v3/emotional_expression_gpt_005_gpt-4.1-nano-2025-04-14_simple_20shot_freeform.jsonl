The Generated rule narrows this to positive emotions, personal reflection, or uplifting experiences, and explicitly excludes neutral, factual, or negative tones. While both rules concern emotional content, the Ground Truth encompasses a wider range of emotions (positive and negative), whereas the Generated rule emphasizes positive and uplifting feelings only. Consequently, they would often differ in classification—particularly in cases involving negative emotions—making their core concepts only partially aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
