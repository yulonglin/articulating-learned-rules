The Ground Truth specifies \"two or more exclamation marks,\" which includes any number of exclamation marks greater than or equal to two, regardless of whether they are consecutive or not. The Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of a double exclamation mark (\"!!\") specifically, which is a particular case of having at least two exclamation marks, and explicitly states that \"!!\" is the distinguishing feature. \n\nThe main difference is that the Ground Truth considers any number of exclamation marks (two or more), while the Generated Rule only considers the specific pattern \"!!\". This means that the Generated Rule might exclude inputs with three or more exclamation marks that are not consecutive (e.g., \"! ! !\") unless they contain \"!!\" explicitly. However, in most typical cases where multiple exclamation marks are present, both rules will produce the same classification.\n\nTherefore, they are very close in logic and would agree on most inputs, with a slight difference in edge cases involving multiple non-consecutive exclamation marks. This justifies a high score of 9.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
