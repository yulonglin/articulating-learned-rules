The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if all alphabetic characters are uppercase and at least one letter exists. The Generated Rule states that the input is True if and only if the entire text is in ALL CAPS (implying all alphabetic characters are uppercase) and False if any lowercase letters are present. These descriptions are essentially equivalent in their core logic: they both classify inputs as True when all alphabetic characters are uppercase and at least one letter exists, and as False otherwise. The main difference is in phrasing—one emphasizes the presence of at least one letter and uppercase condition, while the other emphasizes the entire text being in all caps. Given this, they align closely in their classification criteria, leading to a high similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
