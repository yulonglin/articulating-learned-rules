The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the overall indication of urgency. The Generated Rule specifies particular language cues (\"urgent,\" \"must,\" \"right away,\" \"immediately\") and clarifies that non-urgent, informational, or gentle reminders should be classified as false. While the Generated Rule provides more detailed criteria and examples, it aligns closely with the core concept of the Ground Truth. They would generally produce similar classifications, especially when the language cues are explicit. However, the Ground Truth is broader and less specific about the exact words, which could lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Therefore, they are highly aligned but not perfectly identical in scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
