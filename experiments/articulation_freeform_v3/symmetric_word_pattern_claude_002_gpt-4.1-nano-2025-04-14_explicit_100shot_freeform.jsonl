It focuses solely on the presence of any palindromic word, without specifying particular words or context.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, specifies a fixed set of words (\"level,\" \"racecar,\" \"madam,\" \"radar\") and emphasizes that their mention must be in a meaningful or literal context. It excludes incidental or metaphorical mentions and requires these specific words, not just any palindrome.  \n\nWhile both rules are centered around the concept of palindromic words, the generated rule narrows the scope to specific words and adds contextual constraints, making it more restrictive. They would produce similar classifications when the text contains one of these specific words used literally, but they would differ in cases where other palindromic words are present or where the context is ambiguous.  \n\nTherefore, they share the core idea of identifying palindromic words but differ significantly in scope and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
