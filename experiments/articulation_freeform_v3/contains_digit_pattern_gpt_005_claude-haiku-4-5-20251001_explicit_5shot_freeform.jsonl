The generated rule broadly classifies statements as True if they contain factual, verifiable information, and False otherwise, emphasizing the nature of the content (factual vs. subjective). These rules do not align because the ground truth rule is based on a specific pattern (digits), whereas the generated rule is based on the type of information (factual vs. subjective). They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classification criteria are fundamentally different. Therefore, they are only loosely related at a high level but do not describe the same logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
