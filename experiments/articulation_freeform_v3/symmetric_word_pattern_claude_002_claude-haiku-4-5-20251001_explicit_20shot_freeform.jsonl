The Ground Truth states \"contains at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which is the core concept. The Generated Rule explicitly states the same criterion, providing examples of common palindromes and clarifying that the classification is true if such a palindrome exists and false otherwise. The main difference is that the generated rule offers illustrative examples and a formal structure, but the underlying logic remains the same. The only minor discrepancy is that the ground truth rule emphasizes the existence of a palindrome word, while the generated rule explicitly states the classification based on the presence of such words, which aligns closely. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same key feature and would produce the same classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
