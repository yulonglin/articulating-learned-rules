In contrast, the generated rule broadly classifies numbers based on their functional or factual purpose, considering whether numbers are essential data versus incidental or aesthetic. While both rules involve the presence of numbers, the ground truth emphasizes a particular numeric pattern, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the contextual role of numbers. They do not necessarily produce the same classifications for most inputs, especially when the input contains numbers that are not sequences of three digits but are used functionally, or sequences of three digits that are incidental. Therefore, their core concepts and key features differ significantly, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
