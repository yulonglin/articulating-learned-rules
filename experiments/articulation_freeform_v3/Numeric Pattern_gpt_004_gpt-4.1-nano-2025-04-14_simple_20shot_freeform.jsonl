The generated rule broadly states that any date-related information or mention of a date in context leads to a positive classification, which is more general and less specific. While both rules aim to identify date references, the generated rule could classify as positive any mention of date-related info, even if not in the specified formats, leading to potential discrepancies. Therefore, they share the core concept of detecting date references but differ significantly in the exact features and patterns they target, resulting in partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
