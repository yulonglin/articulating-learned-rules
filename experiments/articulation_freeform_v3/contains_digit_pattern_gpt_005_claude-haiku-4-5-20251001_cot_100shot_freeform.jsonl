The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria significantly, accepting sequences of 2 to 4 digits (excluding certain time formats and leading zeros) that serve as identifiers or references, and explicitly excludes sequences of 4 identical digits or longer than 4 digits. This means the generated rule encompasses more patterns (e.g., two-digit sequences, four-digit sequences not necessarily consecutive, and sequences in specific contexts) and excludes some that the ground truth would include (e.g., exactly three consecutive digits). While both rules involve digit sequences, their core patterns and conditions differ substantially, leading to different classifications in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.52,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.52},"parse_error":false}
