The Ground Truth rule specifies that the input must be all uppercase alphabetic characters with at least one letter, which directly aligns with the core concept of the Generated Rule—classifying inputs as True when they are entirely or nearly entirely uppercase. The main difference is that the Ground Truth explicitly requires all alphabetic characters to be uppercase and at least one letter, whereas the Generated Rule allows for \"nearly all uppercase,\" which could include inputs with minor lowercase characters or slight deviations. Despite this nuance, in most cases, both rules will produce the same classification, especially for inputs that are strictly uppercase or contain lowercase letters. The core concept of identifying uppercase formatting is consistent, making them largely equivalent in intent and outcome, with only minor differences in strictness.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
