The Generated Rule, however, classifies based on whether the sentence expresses doubt, concern, difficulty, or a negative/challenging personal experience, which are broader emotional or subjective states. While negative sentences often contain negation words, they can also express negativity without explicit negation (e.g., \"I'm worried\" or \"It's difficult\"). Conversely, some sentences with negation words may not be negative in sentiment (e.g., \"I do not think that is correct\" might be neutral or analytical). Therefore, the two rules do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would only align partially. They are related but not equivalent in core concept or pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
