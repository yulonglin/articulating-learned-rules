The Ground Truth specifies the text is a \"polite, formal request or application,\" focusing on the nature of the text itself. The Generated Rule broadens this to include inquiries related to applying, enrolling, or requesting permission, and explicitly states that non-request statements are classified as False. While they largely overlap in identifying formal requests, the Generated Rule introduces additional categories (e.g., inquiries about applying or permission) and explicitly excludes casual or descriptive statements. Therefore, they share core concepts but differ slightly in scope and specificity, leading to mostly aligned but not perfectly identical classifications.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
