It classifies texts as True only if they contain such a sequence, regardless of context or purpose. The generated rule, however, broadly considers any \"3+ digit number\" used as a \"specific identifier, code, measurement, or reference,\" and explicitly excludes casual or incidental uses, such as dates or times, or small numbers embedded in natural language. While both rules focus on numeric sequences, the ground truth is pattern-specific, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the functional or referential role of the number, which can include longer sequences and excludes casual mentions. They overlap somewhat in identifying numeric sequences, but the generated rule is more permissive and context-dependent, leading to different classifications in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
