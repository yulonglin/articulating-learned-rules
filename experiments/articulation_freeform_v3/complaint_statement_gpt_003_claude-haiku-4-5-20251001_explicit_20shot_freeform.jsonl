The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on direct expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule captures this by classifying texts as True if they \"express a negative experience, complaint, or disappointment,\" and as False if they are neutral or positive. \n\nWhile the phrasing differs—Ground Truth emphasizes explicit criticism, and the Generated Rule emphasizes negative experience or dissatisfaction—the core concept of identifying negative or critical sentiment is consistent. The main difference is that the Generated Rule allows for some ambiguity (\"merely descriptive\" or \"neutral\") that might include texts not explicitly critical but still negative, whereas the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction.\n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying texts that express dissatisfaction or criticism, but the Ground Truth is slightly more restrictive in requiring explicit criticism, whereas the Generated Rule is broader in including negative experiences that may not be explicitly critical. This results in a high degree of overlap but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
