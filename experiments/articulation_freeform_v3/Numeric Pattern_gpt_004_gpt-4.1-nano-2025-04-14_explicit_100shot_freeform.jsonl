It implicitly assumes that only valid dates are considered, focusing on correctly formatted, valid calendar dates.\n\nThe generated rule broadens this by stating that any date in common formats, whether valid or invalid, should lead to a positive classification, including dates with invalid day/month combinations or leap year issues. It also emphasizes that the date refers to a specific calendar date, but explicitly includes invalid dates as well.\n\nWhile both rules focus on detecting dates in similar formats, the key difference lies in validity:  \n- Ground truth emphasizes valid, correctly formatted dates.  \n- Generated rule includes invalid dates as well.\n\nThey share the core concept of identifying date patterns in specific formats, but the generated rule's inclusion of invalid dates means their classification criteria are not perfectly aligned. Therefore, they would produce similar results in many cases but diverge when invalid dates are present.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in scope and specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
