The Ground Truth emphasizes the overall nature (\"polite, formal request or application\"), while the Generated Rule specifies that the input contains a polite, formal request or inquiry seeking permission, guidance, or assistance. They largely overlap in identifying requests of a polite, formal nature. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes seeking permission, guidance, or assistance, which may broaden or slightly shift the scope compared to the more general \"request or application\" in the Ground Truth. Despite this, they are similar enough that most inputs fitting one rule would fit the other, leading to mostly aligned classifications. The core concept of recognizing polite, formal requests is consistent, but the phrasing and scope details differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
