In contrast, the generated rule centers solely on the presence and emotional use of an exclamation mark, emphasizing emotional expression rather than punctuation count. While both rules involve exclamation marks, the ground truth does not specify emotional context or quantity, and the generated rule does not consider other punctuation marks. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ, especially in texts with multiple punctuation marks but no emotional exclamation, or texts with emotional exclamation but fewer than three punctuation marks. The core concepts are related to punctuation and emotional tone but are not equivalent in scope or criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
