The ground truth emphasizes that all alphabetic characters are uppercase and that there is at least one letter, implicitly allowing non-letter characters (punctuation, numbers). The generated rule explicitly states that the entire text must be exclusively uppercase letters (plus punctuation/numbers), with no lowercase letters present, which aligns with the ground truth's intent. \n\nThe main difference is that the generated rule explicitly excludes lowercase letters and allows non-letter characters, whereas the ground truth's wording could be interpreted as focusing solely on alphabetic characters being uppercase and at least one letter existing, regardless of other characters. Despite this slight nuance, the core concepts—uppercase alphabetic characters and the presence of at least one letter—are effectively equivalent.\n\nTherefore, they describe the same classification logic in practice, but the phrasing differs slightly in emphasis.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
