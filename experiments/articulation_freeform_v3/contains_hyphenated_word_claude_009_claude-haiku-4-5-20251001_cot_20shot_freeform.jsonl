The Ground Truth specifies any word with a hyphen connecting two parts, which includes all hyphenated words regardless of their grammatical role. The Generated Rule narrows this to hyphenated compound adjectives specifically, providing examples like \"well-known\" and \"high-quality.\" While the core concept—presence of hyphenated words—is similar, the generated rule emphasizes a particular subset (compound adjectives) and explicitly states \"adjectives joined by hyphens,\" which may exclude other hyphenated words that are not adjectives (e.g., \"part-time,\" \"mother-in-law\"). Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly equivalent, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
