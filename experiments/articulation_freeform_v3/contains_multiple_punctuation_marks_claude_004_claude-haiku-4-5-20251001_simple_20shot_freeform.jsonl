The generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of direct speech (quotation marks) or multiple independent clauses separated by semicolons, which are stylistic features associated with dialogue or conversational tone. While both rules relate to punctuation and sentence structure, they do not align perfectly: the ground truth does not specify dialogue or clause separation, and the generated rule considers features (dialogue, semicolons) that may not necessarily correspond to the count of punctuation marks. Therefore, they only partially overlap in identifying similar patterns and would not produce identical classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
