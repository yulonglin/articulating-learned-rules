The Ground Truth rule specifies that the text must contain at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome). The Generated rule expands this by including embedded palindromic patterns within words, not just standalone palindromes, and emphasizes the presence of such patterns in both true and false examples. While the core concept—detecting palindromic words—is shared, the generated rule introduces additional complexity by considering embedded palindromes and the context of examples, which may lead to subtle differences in classification. Overall, they are closely aligned in intent but differ slightly in detail, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
