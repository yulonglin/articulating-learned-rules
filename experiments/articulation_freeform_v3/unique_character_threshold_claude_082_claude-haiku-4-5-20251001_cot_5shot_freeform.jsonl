The generated rule, however, classifies based on sentence length, grammatical form (imperative), and repetition, which are linguistic features unrelated to character count. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns. They would rarely produce the same classification on the same input, as their core concepts are different—one is about character diversity, the other about sentence structure and repetition.
