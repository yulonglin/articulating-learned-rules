The generated rule broadly classifies inputs as True if they contain any number serving a practical purpose, which could include various digit sequences of different lengths and contexts, not necessarily three consecutive digits. While both rules involve digit sequences, their key features differ: the ground truth focuses on a specific pattern, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the contextual or functional role of the number. They do not produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially those with digit sequences that are not exactly three consecutive digits but still serve practical purposes. Therefore, their core concepts are related but not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
