The Ground Truth Rule specifies topics explicitly related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on content related to finance. The Generated Rule broadens this to include markets and economic phenomena, and explicitly states when to classify as True or False, emphasizing financial concepts versus non-financial topics like nature or leisure. While the core concept—identifying financial content—is consistent, the Generated Rule introduces additional categories (markets, economic phenomena) and clarifies the classification logic more explicitly. These differences mean they are very similar but not perfectly aligned, hence a high score but not a perfect one.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
