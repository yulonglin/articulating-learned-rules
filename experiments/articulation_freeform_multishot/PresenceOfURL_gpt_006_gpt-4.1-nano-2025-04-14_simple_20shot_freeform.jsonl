The Ground Truth rule considers URLs starting specifically with 'http' or 'www', capturing common URL patterns but potentially missing URLs that start with other schemes (like 'https') or without 'www'. The Generated Rule explicitly includes 'http://' and 'https://', which are common URL prefixes, and also checks for 'www.', covering similar patterns but with slightly more explicit criteria.  \n\nThey share the core concept of detecting web addresses, but differ slightly in the specific patterns they recognize. The Ground Truth might miss URLs starting with 'https://' or other schemes, while the Generated Rule explicitly includes 'https://', making it slightly more comprehensive. Overall, they are similar in intent and key features, but not perfectly aligned in pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
