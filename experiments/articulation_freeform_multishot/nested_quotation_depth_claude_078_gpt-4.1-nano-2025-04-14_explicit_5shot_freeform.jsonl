Its core feature is the presence of deeply nested quoted text. The generated rule, however, specifies a pattern involving the word \"replied\" followed by a quoted phrase containing \"Stop,\" which is a different pattern entirely. It emphasizes specific words (\"replied\" and \"Stop\") and a particular sequence, not nested quotes at multiple levels. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concepts are not equivalent, making the two rules fundamentally different in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
