The ground truth rule emphasizes ignoring spaces and case, which is a key detail; the generated rule mentions \"reads the same forwards and backwards\" but does not explicitly specify ignoring spaces and case. Assuming the generated rule implicitly includes these considerations (as it refers to a standard definition of a palindrome), the core concept—identifying palindromes—is the same. The main difference is the explicit mention of ignoring spaces and case in the ground truth, which is a crucial detail for equivalence. Overall, they describe the same classification logic with minor phrasing differences, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
