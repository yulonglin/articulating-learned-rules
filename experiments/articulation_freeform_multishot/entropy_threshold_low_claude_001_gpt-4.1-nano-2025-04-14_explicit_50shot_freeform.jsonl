This approach captures a broad pattern related to character predictability and diversity.\n\nThe generated rule classifies text as TRUE only if it consists entirely of alphabetic characters, ignoring the overall distribution or entropy of the characters. It is a strict, syntactic criterion based solely on character types, not on the statistical distribution or predictability of characters.\n\nWhile both rules tend to classify simple, predictable, or repetitive texts as TRUE, they do so based on different features: one on entropy (a statistical measure of unpredictability) and the other on character composition (alphabetic-only). They may agree on many inputs (e.g., all alphabetic strings with low entropy), but they can diverge significantly—for example, a string with mixed characters but low entropy (e.g., repeated patterns of a few characters) would be FALSE under the generated rule but might be TRUE under the entropy-based rule if the entropy is below 4.2 bits.\n\nOverall, they do not describe the same core concept, and their classifications will often differ, especially on more complex or mixed-content inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
