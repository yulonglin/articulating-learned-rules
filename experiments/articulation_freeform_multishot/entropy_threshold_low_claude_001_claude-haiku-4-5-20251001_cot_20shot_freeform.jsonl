This captures the overall character distribution, regardless of word count or structure.  \n\nThe generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains only a single word or exclamation, and FALSE otherwise. This focuses on the number of words, not on character distribution or entropy.  \n\nWhile both rules tend to identify very simple, repetitive, or monosyllabic inputs as TRUE, they do so based on different features: one on character predictability, the other on word count. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., single-word inputs with repetitive characters), but they are not equivalent in core concept or in the features they analyze.  \n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and are only loosely related in their outcomes.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
