The generated rule, however, centers on identifying at least two words that are either identical (case-insensitive) or share a common suffix of at least 2 characters, which pertains to word similarity or shared endings. These are fundamentally different features: one is about internal letter casing patterns, the other about word identity or suffix similarity. They do not target the same key features or patterns, and thus would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs. The core concepts are not equivalent, making the two rules largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
