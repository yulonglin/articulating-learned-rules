The generated rule, however, classifies a text as True only if there is an alphabetic character immediately adjacent to at least one punctuation mark, and it requires at least one such adjacency. This introduces a different pattern: the ground truth emphasizes the total number of punctuation marks regardless of their position relative to alphabetic characters, while the generated rule emphasizes the proximity of alphabetic characters to punctuation marks, and only requires one such adjacency. As a result, they may produce different classifications on many inputs, especially those with multiple punctuation marks not adjacent to alphabetic characters, or with adjacent alphabetic characters but fewer than three punctuation marks overall. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core logic, though they both involve punctuation and alphabetic characters.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
