The generated rule specifies that the input must contain a complete date with a month name, day number, and year, which aligns with the 'Month Day, Year' format but ignores the numeric 'DD/MM/YYYY' format. Therefore, they share some core concept of identifying date patterns but differ significantly in the specific date formats they recognize. The generated rule would miss dates in the numeric format, leading to different classifications on many inputs. Overall, they are related but not equivalent in scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
