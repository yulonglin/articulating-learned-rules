In contrast, the generated rule explicitly looks for a specific sequence (\"a an\") followed by two long or complex words, and classifies based on that pattern. These rules do not share key features or patterns: one is based on overall word length distribution, the other on a particular phrase and the presence of long words afterward. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as the ground truth captures a general property of word length variance, while the generated rule targets a specific phrase and word complexity pattern.
