The Generated rule emphasizes whether the sentence conveys an emotional or psychological experience, including positive feelings, pride, relief, or tears, and distinguishes emotional impact from neutral or descriptive statements. While both rules aim to identify emotional content, the Generated rule introduces specific examples (pride, relief, tears) and emphasizes emotional impact rather than just the presence of an emotional state. They share the core concept of detecting emotional significance but differ in scope and detail, leading to potential differences in classification, especially in borderline cases. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
