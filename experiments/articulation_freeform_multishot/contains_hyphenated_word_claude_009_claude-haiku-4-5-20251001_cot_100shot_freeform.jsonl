It captures any hyphenated compound, such as \"well-known\" or \"up-to-date.\" The Generated Rule, however, explicitly lists certain hyphenated compounds (e.g., \"self-aware,\" \"state-of-the-art,\" \"high-quality,\" \"well-known,\" \"up-to-date\") and also includes additional conditions involving specific word combinations like \"jumps\" with \"quick/testing\" or other patterns. This makes the generated rule more restrictive and pattern-specific, not just based on hyphenation but also on particular words or combinations.\n\nWhile both rules identify hyphenated words as a key feature, the generated rule introduces extra conditions that are not present in the ground truth. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic entirely. They share the core concept of recognizing hyphenated words but differ significantly in scope and specificity.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in their criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
