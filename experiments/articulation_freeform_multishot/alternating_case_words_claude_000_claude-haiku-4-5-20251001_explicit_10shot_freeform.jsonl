In contrast, the generated rule requires the text to have at least five words and the presence of at least one word appearing in both lowercase and mixed-case forms (i.e., case variation across different instances of the same word). This introduces a different pattern: the ground truth emphasizes internal letter case alternation within a word, while the generated rule emphasizes case variation across different occurrences of the same word and a minimum word count.\n\nThey do not identify the same key features:  \n- The ground truth is about a specific internal pattern within a word.  \n- The generated rule is about case variation across words and a minimum number of words.\n\nWould they produce the same classifications? Likely not, because many texts could satisfy one rule but not the other. For example, a text with a single word with alternating case (matching the ground truth) but fewer than five words would be classified differently. Conversely, a text with five words and case variation across words but no word with internal alternating case would also be classified differently.\n\nCore concepts are not equivalent: one centers on internal letter case patterns, the other on case variation across words and word count.\n\nTherefore, they are largely different in pattern detection and classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
