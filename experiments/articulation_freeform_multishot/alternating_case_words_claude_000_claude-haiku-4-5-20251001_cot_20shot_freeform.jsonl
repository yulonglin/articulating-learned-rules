The ground truth specifies \"letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase,\" which suggests a pattern like 'aBcDeF' where each subsequent letter switches case, implying a strict alternating pattern within a single word. The generated rule states \"mixed case (both uppercase and lowercase letters),\" which is a broader criterion that includes any word with at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter, regardless of order or pattern. \n\nThey are similar in that they both focus on the presence of mixed case within words, but the ground truth emphasizes a specific pattern (alternation), while the generated rule is more general. As a result, they would classify most words with mixed case similarly, but the ground truth might exclude words with non-alternating mixed case (e.g., 'aBcDeF' vs. 'aBCdeF'). \n\nOverall, the core concept of detecting mixed case is aligned, but the specific pattern requirement differs slightly. Therefore, they are quite similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
