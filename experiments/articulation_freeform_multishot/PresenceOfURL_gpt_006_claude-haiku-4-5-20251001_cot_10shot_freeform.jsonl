The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', focusing on these specific patterns. The Generated Rule broadens this to include patterns like 'www.', 'http://', or 'https://', which are common URL indicators. While the core concept—detecting URLs—is the same, the generated rule's inclusion of 'https://' and the phrasing \"like www., http://, or https://\" makes it slightly more comprehensive. They would produce identical classifications in most cases, especially when URLs follow these common patterns. The main difference is the explicit mention of 'https://' in the generated rule, which is a minor variation. Overall, they are very similar in intent and function, hence a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
