The generated rule, however, requires the input to have at least five words and to contain at least one word that appears in both lowercase and a different case variation elsewhere in the input, emphasizing mixed case presence across multiple words rather than within a single word. These are fundamentally different features: one looks for a specific internal pattern in a word, the other for case variation across multiple words and a minimum word count. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, and their core concepts—internal letter pattern versus case variation across words—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
