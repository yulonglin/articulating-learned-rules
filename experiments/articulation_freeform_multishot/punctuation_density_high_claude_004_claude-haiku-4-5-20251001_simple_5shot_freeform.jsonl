The generated rule, however, classifies text as TRUE based on the presence of uncertainty, hesitation, or questioning signals such as ellipses, question marks, or hedging language, regardless of punctuation density. While both rules involve punctuation, their core features differ: one focuses on quantitative punctuation proportion, the other on qualitative cues of uncertainty. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., texts with many question marks), but generally, they target different patterns and would not produce the same classifications consistently.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
