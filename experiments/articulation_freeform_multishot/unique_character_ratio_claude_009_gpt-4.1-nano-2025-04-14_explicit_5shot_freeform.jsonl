This can include texts with repeated characters, but also potentially texts with a small set of characters repeated in various patterns, not necessarily identical characters.\n\nThe generated rule specifically identifies texts composed solely of repeated instances of a single lowercase letter (possibly separated by spaces), with no other characters or punctuation. This is a much narrower criterion, capturing only perfectly uniform repetitions of one character, rather than any pattern with limited character variety.\n\nWhile both rules tend to classify highly repetitive texts as TRUE, the ground truth rule is broader and can include texts with some variation (e.g., a small set of characters repeated), whereas the generated rule only captures exact uniform repetitions of a single character.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual similarity—both relate to repetition and limited character diversity—but differ significantly in scope and specificity.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
