The Ground Truth specifies that the text must express a positive sentiment *about* a product or service, focusing on the sentiment and the target. The Generated Rule broadens this to include reviews or recommendations of specific entities, emphasizing positive evaluations, and explicitly excludes general statements about activities or observations not related to a purchasable product or service. While they largely overlap in identifying positive evaluations of products/services, the Generated Rule introduces a broader scope (including recommendations) and clarifies what is excluded, which slightly shifts the core focus. Overall, they are similar in intent but differ in phrasing and scope, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
