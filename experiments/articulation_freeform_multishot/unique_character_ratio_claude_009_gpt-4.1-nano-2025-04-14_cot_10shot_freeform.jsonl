The Ground Truth rule uses a quantitative measure—the ratio of unique characters to total characters—classifying as TRUE when this ratio is below 0.15, which effectively captures strings with low diversity or high repetition. The Generated rule describes a pattern of repeated single-letter sequences, which aligns with the idea of high repetition and limited character variety.\n\nHowever, the generated rule explicitly specifies that the string consists solely of repeated instances of a single letter (possibly separated by spaces), whereas the ground truth rule is based on a ratio that could include strings with some variation, as long as the overall ratio remains below 0.15. This means the generated rule is more restrictive and may exclude some strings that the ground truth rule would classify as TRUE (e.g., strings with a few additional unique characters but still low ratio). Conversely, the ground truth rule might classify some strings as TRUE that do not strictly follow the pattern of repeated single-letter sequences.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of low character diversity and high repetition, but the ground truth rule is more flexible and quantitative, while the generated rule is more specific and pattern-based. Therefore, they are similar in intent but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
