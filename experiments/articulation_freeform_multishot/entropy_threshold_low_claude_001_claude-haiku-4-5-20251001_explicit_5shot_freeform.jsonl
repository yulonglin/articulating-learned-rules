The generated rule, however, classifies based on semantic content—distinguishing literal statements from idiomatic or figurative expressions—without any direct measure of character entropy. While both rules tend to classify straightforward, literal text as TRUE and idiomatic or metaphorical sayings as FALSE, they do so based on different criteria: one on statistical character patterns, the other on semantic content. Consequently, they may agree in many cases but can diverge significantly, especially with texts that are literal but complex (high entropy) or idiomatic but simple (low entropy). Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their classifications may not always align.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
