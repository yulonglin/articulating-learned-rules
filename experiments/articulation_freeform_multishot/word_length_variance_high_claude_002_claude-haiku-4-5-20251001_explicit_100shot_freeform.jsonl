This approach captures a broad pattern related to the distribution of word lengths, regardless of the specific words used.\n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses narrowly on a particular syntactic pattern (\"I am [word1] [word2]\") and the complexity of those two words, requiring both to be long or sophisticated vocabulary. It does not consider overall word length distribution or variance, nor does it analyze the entire text's structure or vocabulary diversity.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify \"complex\" or \"inconsistent\" language, they do so via fundamentally different features: one via statistical variance in word lengths, the other via syntactic pattern and word complexity. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., a sentence with long, complex words might also have high variance in word length), but they are not equivalent in scope or criteria.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications would often differ on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
