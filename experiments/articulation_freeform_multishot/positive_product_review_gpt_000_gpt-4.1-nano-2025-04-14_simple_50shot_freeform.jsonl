The Generated rule broadens this to include any mention of tangible benefits, improvements, or positive results, which may encompass personal experiences or outcomes that are not necessarily tied to explicit positive sentiment. Additionally, the Generated rule excludes observations or general descriptions without direct personal benefit, which may differ from the Ground Truth's focus on sentiment. While there is some overlap—both involve positive aspects related to products or services—the core emphasis on sentiment versus tangible benefits and the scope of what is considered positive differ enough that they would not always produce the same classifications.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
