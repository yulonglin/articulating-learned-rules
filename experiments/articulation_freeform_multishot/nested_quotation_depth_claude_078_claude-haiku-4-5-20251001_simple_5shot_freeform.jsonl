The Ground Truth specifies that the text must contain quoted sections nested at least two levels deep, exemplified by quotes within quotes using escaped quotes. The Generated Rule states that the output is True when a nested quotation (a quote within a quote, indicated by escaped quotes like `\\\"`) exists, and False otherwise. They largely focus on the same core concept: detecting nested quotations, especially those involving escaped quotes. However, the Ground Truth emphasizes the depth of nesting (at least two levels), while the Generated Rule broadly considers any nested quotation indicated by escaped quotes, which may include single-level nesting as well. This slight difference in emphasis on nesting depth accounts for the slight deduction. Overall, they are closely aligned in identifying nested quotations, making them highly similar in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
