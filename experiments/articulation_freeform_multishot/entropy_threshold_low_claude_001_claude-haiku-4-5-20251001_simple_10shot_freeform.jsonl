This approach captures the statistical uniformity or predictability of the text, regardless of its semantic content.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies inputs based on their syntactic form—specifically, whether they are exclamations, interjections, or single-word responses—versus complete proverbs, idioms, or multi-word phrases with conventional wisdom. This is a semantic and structural criterion, not directly related to character entropy.  \n\nWhile both rules aim to distinguish certain types of short, simple, or predictable texts from more complex or meaningful ones, they do so via different features: one via statistical character distribution, the other via linguistic form. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., short, predictable responses might have low entropy), but they are not equivalent in core logic.  \n\nTherefore, the two rules do not describe the same classification logic, and their agreement on most inputs is limited.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
