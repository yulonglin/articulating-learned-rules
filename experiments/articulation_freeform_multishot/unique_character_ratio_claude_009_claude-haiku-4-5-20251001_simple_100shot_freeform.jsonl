It focuses on a numerical threshold that captures the overall character diversity in the input.\n\nThe generated rule, however, describes a qualitative pattern: it considers inputs composed of a single character or a small set of repeated characters, possibly with minor variations, and classifies them as TRUE. Conversely, it labels inputs with multiple distinct words or diverse characters as FALSE.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify inputs with limited character diversity, the ground truth rule is more precise and broad, capturing any text with low character variety regardless of structure. The generated rule emphasizes specific patterns of repetition and small character sets, which may not encompass all cases where the ratio of unique characters is low. For example, a long string of a single character would be TRUE under both rules, but a text with many repeated characters that still has a higher ratio might be classified differently.\n\nOverall, they share a core concept—detecting limited character variety—but differ in their approach and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
