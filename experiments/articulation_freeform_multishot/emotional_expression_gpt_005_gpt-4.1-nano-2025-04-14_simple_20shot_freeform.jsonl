The generated rule, however, narrows this to positive emotions or moods (happiness, joy, love) and explicitly excludes neutral or negative scenarios. While both rules aim to identify emotional content, the generated rule emphasizes positive emotions and excludes negative or neutral ones, whereas the ground truth includes all clear emotional states regardless of valence. Therefore, they share some overlap but differ significantly in scope and focus, leading to different classifications in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
