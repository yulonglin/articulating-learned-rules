In contrast, the generated rule emphasizes the presence of multiple consecutive punctuation marks (e.g., !!!, ...), which convey emotion or emphasis, and explicitly excludes single punctuation at sentence ends. While both rules involve punctuation patterns, they target different features: the ground truth assesses overall punctuation density, whereas the generated rule targets specific punctuation sequences associated with emotional expression. Consequently, they would often produce different classifications, especially in texts with high punctuation density but no repeated sequences, or vice versa. The core concepts—punctuation proportion versus specific punctuation patterns—are not equivalent, leading to limited overlap in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
