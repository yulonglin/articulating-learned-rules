The generated rule specifies URLs starting with \"http://\", \"https://\", which are more precise and exclude URLs that start with \"www\" without the \"http\" prefix. Additionally, the ground truth rule's inclusion of \"www\" as a pattern is more general, potentially capturing URLs that do not necessarily start with \"http\" or \"https\". While both rules aim to identify URLs, the key patterns differ: the ground truth emphasizes \"http\" or \"www\" at the start, whereas the generated rule emphasizes \"http(s)://\". They would largely agree on many inputs containing \"http://\" or \"https://\", but may differ on URLs starting with \"www\" without \"http\" prefix, or other URL formats. Therefore, they are similar but not fully equivalent in pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
