The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which is a broad but clear indicator of urgency. The Generated Rule specifies that texts are labeled as True if they contain explicit emergency or urgent language, listing specific keywords and situations, and states that absence of such language suggests a non-urgent message.\n\nThe core concept—detecting messages that signal urgent or emergency scenarios—is consistent between the two. The main difference lies in the level of detail: the Ground Truth is more general, while the Generated Rule provides explicit keywords and examples. Despite this, both rules fundamentally aim to classify messages based on the presence of urgent/emergency indicators.\n\nThey would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs, especially those containing explicit urgent language. However, the Generated Rule's reliance on specific keywords might miss some nuanced or implicit cases that the broader Ground Truth rule could catch, or vice versa.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are aligned, making them largely equivalent in intent and logic, but with slight differences in specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
