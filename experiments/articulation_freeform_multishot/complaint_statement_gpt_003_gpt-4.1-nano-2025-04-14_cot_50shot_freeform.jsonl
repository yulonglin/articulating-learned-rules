The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of problems, poor service, or inconvenience, and clarifies that positive or neutral statements are classified as False. They largely overlap in identifying negative experiences as True cases. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes a broader set of negative indicators and provides a more detailed classification criterion, which may lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Overall, they are very similar in core concept but differ slightly in phrasing and scope, hence a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
