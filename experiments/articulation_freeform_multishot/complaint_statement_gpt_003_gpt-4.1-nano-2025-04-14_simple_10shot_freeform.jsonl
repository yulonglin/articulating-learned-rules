The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of such explicit language. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any expression of a negative experience, complaint, or criticism, and explicitly states that positive or neutral observations are not included. While there is a slight difference in phrasing—one emphasizes explicit statements, the other includes any negative experience—the core concept of detecting negative sentiment or criticism is aligned. They would largely produce similar classifications, though the Generated Rule might be slightly more inclusive of less explicit negative statements. Overall, they are closely aligned in intent and key features, but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
