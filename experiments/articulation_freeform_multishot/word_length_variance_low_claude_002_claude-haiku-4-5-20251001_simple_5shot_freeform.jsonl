This emphasizes the consistency of word lengths within the text, regardless of the specific words used. In contrast, the generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains at least three words of length 3 or more, focusing on the presence and number of substantial words rather than their length distribution. These criteria are quite different: the first assesses uniformity in word length, while the second assesses the presence of multiple longer words. They may occasionally align (e.g., texts with many similar-length words that are all ≥3 letters), but generally, they identify different features and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
