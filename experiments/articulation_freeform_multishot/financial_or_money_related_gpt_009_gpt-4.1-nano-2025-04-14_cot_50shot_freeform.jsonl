The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on specific subject areas. The Generated rule emphasizes whether the sentence discusses financial, economic, or investment-related concepts versus personal, recreational, or non-financial topics. While the phrasing differs, the core pattern—distinguishing financial/economic content from non-financial content—is similar. They identify similar key features and would likely produce the same classifications in most cases. The slight difference is that the Generated rule explicitly includes \"economic\" and \"investment\" concepts and explicitly excludes personal or recreational topics, which aligns closely with the Ground Truth. Therefore, they are largely equivalent in their classification logic, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
