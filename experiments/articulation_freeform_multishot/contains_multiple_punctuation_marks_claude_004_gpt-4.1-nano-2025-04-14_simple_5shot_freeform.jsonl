The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if there is at least one word containing a punctuation mark attached or embedded within it, regardless of the total number of punctuation marks. While both rules involve punctuation, the ground truth emphasizes the total count of punctuation marks, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of punctuation within words. They do not necessarily produce the same classifications, especially in cases where an input has multiple punctuation marks but none attached to words, or vice versa. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
