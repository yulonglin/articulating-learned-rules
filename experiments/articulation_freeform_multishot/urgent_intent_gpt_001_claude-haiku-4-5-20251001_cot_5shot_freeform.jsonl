The Ground Truth emphasizes \"an urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the urgency and immediacy. The Generated Rule specifies classification based on descriptions of \"immediate emergency or critical situation involving danger to human safety or life\" requiring urgent action, and explicitly excludes routine or non-emergency messages. While they largely overlap in identifying urgent, critical situations, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader and less specific about the nature of the emergency (e.g., it doesn't explicitly mention danger to safety or life). The Generated Rule emphasizes danger to safety or life, which may exclude some urgent but less critical requests. Overall, they cover similar concepts but differ slightly in scope and specificity, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
