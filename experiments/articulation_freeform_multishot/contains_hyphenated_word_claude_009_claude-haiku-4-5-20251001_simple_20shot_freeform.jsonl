The Generated Rule also requires the presence of a hyphenated word but adds an additional condition: the input must contain at least one word from a specific set of allowed words. This extra condition means that the Generated Rule is more restrictive and will classify some inputs as False even if they contain hyphenated words, provided those words are not in the allowed set. Conversely, the Ground Truth rule would classify those same inputs as True if they contain hyphenated words regardless of other content. Therefore, while both rules rely on hyphenated words as a key feature, the Generated Rule introduces an additional criterion that makes their classification logic not fully equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
