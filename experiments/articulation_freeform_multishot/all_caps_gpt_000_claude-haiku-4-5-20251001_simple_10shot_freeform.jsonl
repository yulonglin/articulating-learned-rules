The Ground Truth specifies that the entire input must be labeled True if all alphabetic characters are uppercase and at least one letter exists. The Generated Rule states that the output is True if all words are in UPPERCASE and False if any word is lowercase. These are essentially equivalent conditions, as checking that all words are uppercase aligns with all alphabetic characters being uppercase, and both rules require at least one letter. The main difference is phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes alphabetic characters and the presence of at least one letter, while the Generated Rule emphasizes words being uppercase. They would produce the same classification on most inputs, especially standard text inputs, making them functionally similar. However, subtle differences in interpretation (e.g., handling non-letter characters or empty inputs) could cause minor discrepancies, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
