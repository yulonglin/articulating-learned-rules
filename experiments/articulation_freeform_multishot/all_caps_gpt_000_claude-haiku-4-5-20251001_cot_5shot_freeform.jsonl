The ground truth specifies that *all* alphabetic characters must be uppercase and that the input must contain at least one letter, which aligns with the generated rule stating that *all words* are in uppercase and that the classification is false if words are lowercase or mixed case. The main difference is that the ground truth emphasizes the presence of at least one letter and the uppercase status of all alphabetic characters, while the generated rule focuses on entire words being uppercase. In practice, these conditions are effectively equivalent, as both require the entire input to be uppercase letters with at least one letter. Minor phrasing differences prevent a perfect score, but the core logic aligns closely.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
