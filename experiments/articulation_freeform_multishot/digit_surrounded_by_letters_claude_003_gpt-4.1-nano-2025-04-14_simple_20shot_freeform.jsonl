The generated rule, however, states that the output is True if the text contains at least one lowercase word with a digit or a sequence of lowercase letters and digits, emphasizing the presence of specific coded words or sequences rather than the positional pattern of digits within words. While both rules involve digits and lowercase letters, the ground truth emphasizes a specific positional pattern (digit surrounded by letters), whereas the generated rule broadly considers any lowercase word with digits or sequences of lowercase letters and digits, which may include patterns not necessarily matching the 'digit surrounded by letters' pattern. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would differ on many inputs. The core concepts are related but not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
