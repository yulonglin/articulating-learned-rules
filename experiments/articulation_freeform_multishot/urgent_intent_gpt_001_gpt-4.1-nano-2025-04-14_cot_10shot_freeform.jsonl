The Generated rule specifies that the message must explicitly convey an emergency situation requiring immediate action, using particular keywords like \"immediately,\" \"urgent,\" or \"evacuate,\" and referencing a critical or dangerous scenario. While both rules aim to identify urgent, action-requiring messages, the generated rule emphasizes explicit keywords and specific scenarios, making it more restrictive. The ground truth is more general, potentially capturing a wider range of urgent messages that may not explicitly mention the specified keywords. Therefore, they share core concepts of urgency and immediate action but differ in specificity and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
