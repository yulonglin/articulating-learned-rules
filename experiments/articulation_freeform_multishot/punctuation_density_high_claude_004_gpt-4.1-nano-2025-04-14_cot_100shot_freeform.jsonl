The generated rule, however, relies on qualitative features such as the presence of expressive punctuation, interjections, or emotionally charged words, which are more about specific patterns and types of language rather than their overall proportion. While both rules aim to identify \"heavy punctuation usage\" or \"strong emotional expression,\" they do so through different lenses: one through a numerical threshold, the other through qualitative indicators. They may overlap in some cases (texts with lots of expressive punctuation likely have high punctuation proportion), but they are not strictly equivalent in identifying the same key features or patterns. Therefore, they would not necessarily produce identical classifications across all inputs, and their core concepts differ despite a related goal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
