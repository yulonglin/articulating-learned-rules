The generated rule, however, emphasizes qualitative features such as the presence of multiple punctuation marks (especially ellipses, question marks, or exclamation marks) that convey emotional intensity, hesitation, or fragmented speech, rather than a specific proportion. While both rules involve punctuation, the ground truth is a numerical threshold, whereas the generated rule is more interpretive and context-dependent. They may overlap in some cases—texts with heavy punctuation likely meet both criteria—but generally, they do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
