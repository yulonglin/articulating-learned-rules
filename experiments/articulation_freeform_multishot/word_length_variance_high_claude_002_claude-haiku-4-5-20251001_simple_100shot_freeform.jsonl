It does not specify particular words or patterns, only a quantitative measure of word length distribution.\n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on a specific pattern (\"I am [long/complex words]\") and the length or complexity of the words following \"I am.\" It focuses on the presence of certain types of words and the sentence structure, not on the statistical distribution of word lengths within the entire text.\n\nWhile both rules are concerned with word length or complexity, their core features differ:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes variance in word lengths across the entire text.  \n- The generated rule emphasizes specific sentence patterns and the length/complexity of certain words.\n\nThey may occasionally produce similar classifications if, for example, a sentence with highly variable word lengths also fits the pattern described, but generally, they target different aspects. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently.\n\nOverall, the two rules are only loosely related in their focus on word length but differ significantly in their approach and criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
