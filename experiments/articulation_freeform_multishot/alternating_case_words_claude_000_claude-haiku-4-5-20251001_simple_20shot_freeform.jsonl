The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria: it classifies texts as True if they contain at least one word with mixed case (which aligns with the ground truth pattern) **or** if they contain a trigger word from a specified set, regardless of casing pattern. Additionally, the generated rule considers the absence of trigger words and uniform casing as a basis for False.\n\nWhile both rules recognize mixed-case words as a key feature, the generated rule introduces an additional condition involving trigger words, which the ground truth rule does not mention. Conversely, the ground truth rule does not consider trigger words or uniform casing as criteria.\n\nTherefore, they share some core concept—detecting words with mixed case—but the generated rule incorporates extra conditions that are not present in the ground truth. This means they will often agree when the only relevant feature is mixed case, but they may diverge when trigger words are involved or when casing patterns differ.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in their logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
