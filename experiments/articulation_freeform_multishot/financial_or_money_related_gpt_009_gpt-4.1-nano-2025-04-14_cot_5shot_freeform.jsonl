The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated rule adds a layer by specifying that True examples contain explicit references to financial or economic concepts (e.g., stock price, fractional reserve banking), while False examples lack such references and describe general activities or locations. \n\nThey identify similar key features—namely, the presence or absence of financial/economic topics—but the Generated rule emphasizes the explicit mention of specific concepts, making it slightly more detailed. Despite this, the core idea remains aligned: both rules distinguish texts based on whether they involve finance/economics. Therefore, they would largely produce the same classifications, with minor differences in sensitivity to explicit references versus broader topic inclusion.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
