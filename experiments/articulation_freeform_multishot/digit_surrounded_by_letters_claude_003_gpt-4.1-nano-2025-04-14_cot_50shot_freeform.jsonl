The ground truth specifies the presence of at least one digit with a letter immediately before and after it anywhere in the text (e.g., 'a5b'). The generated rule refines this to focus specifically on words containing embedded alphanumeric patterns with adjacent letter and digit characters, implying the same core pattern but within individual words.  \n\nThey generally identify similar cases—strings with 'a5b' or words like 'a5b'—and would likely produce similar classifications in many instances. However, the generated rule emphasizes the pattern within words, which might exclude some cases where the pattern appears across word boundaries or in non-word segments, potentially leading to differences in some edge cases.  \n\nOverall, the core concept of detecting adjacent letter-digit pairs is consistent, but the scope and phrasing differ slightly, preventing a perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
