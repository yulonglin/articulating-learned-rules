The Generated Rule broadly classifies sentences based on whether they describe human actions, behaviors, or traits versus scenes or natural phenomena without human agency. While both rules aim to distinguish sentences involving human subjects and traits from those describing non-human phenomena, the Ground Truth explicitly requires third-person perspective, whereas the Generated Rule centers on the presence of human-related content regardless of perspective. They largely overlap in identifying human-centered descriptions but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to mostly similar classifications but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
