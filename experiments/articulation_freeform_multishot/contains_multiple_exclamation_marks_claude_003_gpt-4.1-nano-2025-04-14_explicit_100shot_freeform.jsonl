The generated rule classifies a text as True if it contains at least one substring of the form `!<letter>`, which requires an exclamation mark immediately followed by an alphabetic character. This is a different pattern: the ground truth does not specify any particular context for the exclamation marks, only their quantity, whereas the generated rule looks for a specific sequence involving an exclamation mark and a letter.  \n\nWhile both rules involve exclamation marks, they differ significantly in the pattern they recognize and the conditions for classification. The generated rule may classify texts with a single exclamation mark (if followed by a letter) as True, even if the total number of exclamation marks is less than two, which would not match the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth requires at least two exclamation marks anywhere in the text, regardless of their position or adjacency to letters.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would diverge in many cases. They are related in that they involve exclamation marks but are not equivalent in core concept or pattern recognition.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
