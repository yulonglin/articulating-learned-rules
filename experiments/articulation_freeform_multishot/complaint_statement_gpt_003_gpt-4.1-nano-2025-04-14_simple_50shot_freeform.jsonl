The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of direct negative language. The Generated rule broadens this to include highlighting negative experiences, issues, or problems, and explicitly states that positive or neutral reviews should be classified as False. While the core concept—detecting negative sentiment or complaints—is aligned, the Generated rule allows for a slightly broader interpretation by including \"highlighting\" issues, which may encompass implicit or less direct expressions of dissatisfaction. Overall, they are very similar and would likely produce the same classification in most cases, but the Generated rule's phrasing introduces a slight potential for broader interpretation.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
