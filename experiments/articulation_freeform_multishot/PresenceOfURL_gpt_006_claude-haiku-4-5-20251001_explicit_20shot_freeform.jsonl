The ground truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', which covers URLs with protocols ('http', 'https') and 'www.' prefixes. The generated rule explicitly states that the presence of a URL with 'http://', 'https://', or 'www.' is sufficient for classification.  \n\nThe main difference is that the ground truth does not explicitly mention 'https' URLs, but since 'http' URLs are included, and 'https' URLs are very common, the generated rule's inclusion of 'https://' aligns well with the intent. The generated rule explicitly states the presence of at least one of these patterns, which matches the core idea of the ground truth.  \n\nPotential minor discrepancy: the ground truth's wording \"starting with 'http' or 'www'\" could be interpreted as any URL beginning with those strings, regardless of protocol or subdomain, whereas the generated rule explicitly specifies protocols and 'www.' prefix. However, practically, these patterns are equivalent for most URLs.  \n\nOverall, the core concept—detecting URLs with specific patterns—is the same, and the rules would produce nearly identical classifications on most inputs.  \n\nTherefore, a high score of 9 reflects their near-equivalence with slight differences in phrasing and explicitness.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
