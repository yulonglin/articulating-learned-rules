The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of clear emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the expression of internal feelings. The Generated Rule broadens this to include explicit or evoked internal emotional or psychological states (e.g., melancholy, despair) and explicitly states that external descriptions (objects, surroundings, sensory details) are labeled \"False.\" While the core concept of identifying internal emotional states is similar, the Generated Rule introduces a more detailed and explicit criterion, including evoked feelings and the exclusion of external descriptions. This may lead to slight differences in classification, especially in borderline cases. Overall, they largely align in intent and pattern recognition but differ slightly in phrasing and scope, resulting in a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
