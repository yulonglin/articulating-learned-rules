The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text must \"explicitly state dissatisfaction or criticize,\" focusing on direct expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule broadens this by classifying as True any input that \"expresses a complaint, problem, defect, poor service, dissatisfaction, or negative experience,\" which aligns closely with the core concept of negative or critical expressions. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule also explicitly includes positive classifications (satisfaction, praise, appreciation) as False, which is consistent with the Ground Truth's focus on negative or critical statements. The main difference is in phrasing and scope: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule encompasses a wider range of negative indicators, potentially capturing more nuanced or indirect expressions.\n\nOverall, they identify similar key features and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs, but the slight difference in phrasing and scope prevents a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
