The generated rule also requires at least one palindrome word but adds an additional condition: the total number of words must be more than 3. This extra requirement means that the generated rule will classify some texts as False that the ground truth would classify as True (e.g., a short sentence with a palindrome word). Conversely, both rules share the core concept of detecting at least one palindromic word. Therefore, they are similar in identifying the key feature but differ in the overall classification logic due to the additional length constraint in the generated rule.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
