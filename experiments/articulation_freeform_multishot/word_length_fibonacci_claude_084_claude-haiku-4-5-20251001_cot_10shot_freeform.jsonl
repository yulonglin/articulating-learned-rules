In contrast, the generated rule classifies based on the presence of gibberish versus real words, a qualitative, content-based criterion. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; one is about word length sequences, the other about word legitimacy. They would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, as their core concepts are fundamentally different. Therefore, they are largely unrelated in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
