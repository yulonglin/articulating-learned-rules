The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of negative sentiment or critique. The Generated rule broadens this to include any expression of a negative experience, complaint, or problem, and explicitly states that positive expressions are classified as false. While the phrasing differs—ground truth emphasizes explicit dissatisfaction, and generated rule includes a broader range of negative experiences—the core concept of distinguishing negative/complaint from positive/praise is aligned. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly includes \"problem\" and \"unmet expectations,\" which may capture some nuances not explicitly stated in the ground truth. Overall, they describe very similar classification logic, with minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
