The ground truth rule specifies ignoring spaces and case, which aligns closely with the generated rule's description of ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly mentions ignoring punctuation, which the ground truth rule does not specify. However, since ignoring spaces and case is a subset of ignoring all non-alphanumeric characters, the core concept remains the same. They would produce identical classifications on most inputs, especially those containing only letters and spaces. The slight difference in phrasing and the explicit mention of punctuation in the generated rule makes them nearly equivalent in intent and outcome, but not perfectly so.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
