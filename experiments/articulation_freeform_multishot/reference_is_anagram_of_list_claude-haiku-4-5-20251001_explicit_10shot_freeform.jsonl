But since the context suggests the focus is on anagrams of \"listen,\" and the examples provided (tinsel, listen, silent, enlist) are all anagrams, the core concept is consistent.\n\nThe main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly states \"contains exactly the same letters,\" which is a precise way of defining an anagram, whereas the Ground Truth's description is more general and includes other words that are not anagrams of \"listen.\"  \n\nOverall, they identify the same key pattern—words that are anagrams of \"listen\"—and would produce similar classifications for most inputs fitting that pattern. The slight difference in phrasing and the mention of other words in the Ground Truth prevent a perfect score, but the core concept remains aligned.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation score is 8.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
