After careful analysis, I notice: **True cases tend to contain at least one word from a \"positive\" set** (like: run, output, text, function, not, never, no, hello, example, testing, python, input, lazy, jumps, cat, dog, over, world, can't, don't, won't), **while False cases predominantly use words from a \"negative\" set** (like: brown, fox, data, code, sample, check, result, mat, sat, value, quick).\n\n**Rule:**\n\nThe input is classified as True if it contains at least one word from a specific \"trigger\" set (including: run, output, text, function, not, never, no, hello, example, testing, python, input, lazy, jumps, cat, dog, over, world, can't, don't, won't, the, is, or), and False if it primarily or exclusively contains words from a restricted set (brown, fox, data, code, sample, check, result, mat, sat, value, quick, and related terms).","keyword_match_score":0.36363636363636365,"rouge_l_score":0.17391304347826086,"llm_judge_score":0.4,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule classifies text as negative if it contains any negation words like \"not,\" \"no,\" or \"never,\" regardless of other content. It focuses solely on the presence of negation words to determine negativity.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies input as True if it contains any trigger words from a specified set—including negation words (\"not,\" \"never,\" \"no\")—but also includes many other words unrelated to negation (e.g., \"run,\" \"hello,\" \"dog,\" \"world,\" \"python,\" etc.). It then classifies as False if the text primarily contains words from a restricted set that seems unrelated to negation or negativity.\n\nKey differences:  \n- The ground truth rule is solely about negation words indicating negativity.  \n- The generated rule relies on a broader set of trigger words, not all of which relate to negation or negativity, and also includes a set of \"restricted\" words that seem unrelated to the core concept.  \n- The core concept of detecting negativity via negation words is only partially captured; the generated rule's inclusion of many unrelated trigger words means it may classify texts differently, especially when negation words are present but other trigger words are absent, or vice versa.\n\nMost inputs containing negation words will likely be classified similarly, but the additional trigger words and the restricted set introduce divergence, reducing overall equivalence.\n\nTherefore, while there is some overlap in recognizing negation, the two rules are not equivalent in their logic or scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
