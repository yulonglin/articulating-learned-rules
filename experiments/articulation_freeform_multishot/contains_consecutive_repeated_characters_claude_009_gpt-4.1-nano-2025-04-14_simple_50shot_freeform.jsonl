The generated rule classifies an input as True if it contains the letter 'i' or 'e', regardless of repetition or other patterns. These rules are based on entirely different features: one on consecutive character repetition, the other on specific letter presence. They would rarely produce the same classification, as they target different patterns and do not overlap in their core concepts. Therefore, they are largely incompatible in logic and classification behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.52,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.52},"parse_error":false}
