The generated rule, however, classifies a text as positive if it contains certain words or contractions, including \"not,\" \"never,\" and \"no,\" but also many unrelated words (e.g., \"text,\" \"run,\" \"python,\" \"dog,\" \"sample\"). It considers the presence of these words or contractions as a trigger for a positive classification, and only classifies as negative if none are present.\n\nKey differences:\n- The ground truth rule focuses solely on negation words to identify negative content.\n- The generated rule flags texts as positive based on a broader set of words, many of which are unrelated to negation or negativity.\n- The generated rule's positive trigger set is much larger and includes neutral or unrelated words, which could lead to different classifications on many inputs.\n\nOverall, they do not describe the same logic. The ground truth is narrowly focused on negation, while the generated rule is based on a set of specific words and contractions that are not limited to negation. Therefore, they are not equivalent, and their classifications would often differ.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
