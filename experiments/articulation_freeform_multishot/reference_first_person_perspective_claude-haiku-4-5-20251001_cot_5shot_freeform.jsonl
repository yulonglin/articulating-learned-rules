The Generated Rule, however, centers on whether the statement reflects personal emotional struggles, internal conflicts, or personal goals/aspirations, which are inherently subjective but do not necessarily require first-person pronouns. While both rules aim to identify subjective, personal content, the Ground Truth rule relies on linguistic markers (pronouns), whereas the Generated rule emphasizes the nature of the content (emotional/internal). They overlap in targeting subjective, personal statements but differ in the key features they prioritize. Consequently, they would often produce similar classifications but could diverge in cases where subjective content is expressed without first-person pronouns or where external descriptions involve internal states.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
