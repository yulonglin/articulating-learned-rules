In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of repeated words, emphasizing lexical repetition rather than word length distribution. These rules target fundamentally different features: one examines word length consistency, the other examines word recurrence. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts—length variance versus repetition—are not equivalent. Therefore, they are largely unrelated in logic and pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
