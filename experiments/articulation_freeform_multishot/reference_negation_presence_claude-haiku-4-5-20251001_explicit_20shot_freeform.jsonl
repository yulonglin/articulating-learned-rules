The generated rule, after analysis, identifies key features such as the presence of contractions (\"can't,\" \"don't,\" \"won't\") and the words \"no\" or \"not\" as indicators for positive classification. Since contractions like \"can't\" and \"don't\" inherently contain negation, the generated rule effectively captures the same negation cues as the ground truth. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly emphasizes contractions and certain negation words, which aligns closely with the ground truth's focus on negation indicators. Therefore, both rules largely agree on the classification criteria, making them nearly equivalent in practice. The slight difference in phrasing or emphasis accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
