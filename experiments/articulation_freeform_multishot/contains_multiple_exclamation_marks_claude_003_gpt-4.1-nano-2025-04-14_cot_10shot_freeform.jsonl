The generated rule classifies an input as True if at least one word contains an exclamation mark somewhere inside it, which is a more restrictive condition—requiring the exclamation mark to be embedded within a word rather than simply present anywhere in the input. While both rules involve the presence of exclamation marks, they differ significantly in the pattern they detect and the threshold for classification. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features and would not produce identical classifications in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
