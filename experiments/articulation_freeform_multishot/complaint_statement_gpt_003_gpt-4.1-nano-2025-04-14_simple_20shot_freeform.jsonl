The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the presence of such explicit language. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any expression of a negative experience, complaint, or dissatisfaction, and classifies positive or neutral inputs as false. While there is a strong overlap in identifying negative sentiments, the Generated Rule may encompass a wider range of negative expressions, including more subtle or implicit complaints, whereas the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements. Overall, they largely align in intent and key features, but the Generated Rule might be slightly more inclusive, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
