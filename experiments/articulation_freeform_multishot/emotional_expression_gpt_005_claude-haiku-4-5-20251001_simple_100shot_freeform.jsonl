The Ground Truth specifies \"a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement,\" focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include a wider range of emotions (pride, fear, relief) and emphasizes that the output is True when describing or expressing an emotion, and False otherwise. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting emotional or feeling states—is aligned, the Generated Rule explicitly includes additional emotions and clarifies that the input must \"describe or express\" these states, which may slightly broaden the scope. The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state,\" which might imply more explicit or overt expressions. \n\nOverall, they largely overlap in intent and pattern recognition, but the Generated Rule's broader inclusion of emotions and emphasis on description/expression makes them not perfectly identical. Therefore, a high score of 8 reflects their strong similarity with minor differences.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
