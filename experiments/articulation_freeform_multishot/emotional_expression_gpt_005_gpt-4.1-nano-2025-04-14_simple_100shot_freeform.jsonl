The Generated Rule broadens this to include not only emotional states but also sensory and mental states associated with happiness, sadness, excitement, relief, or anger, and specifies certain words that often express these states. It also explicitly states that descriptions of neutral, physical, or observational scenarios without emotional or mental connotations should be classified as False.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify emotional or mental states, the Generated Rule introduces additional categories (sensory, mental states, relief) and specific lexical cues, making it somewhat more inclusive. However, it also explicitly excludes neutral or purely physical descriptions, aligning with the core intent of the Ground Truth Rule.\n\nOverall, they largely overlap in identifying emotional states but differ slightly in scope and detail. The core concept—detecting emotional or mental states—is consistent, but the phrasing and additional criteria in the Generated Rule make them not perfectly aligned.\n\nTherefore, a score of 6 reflects that they are similar in intent but not identical in scope and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
