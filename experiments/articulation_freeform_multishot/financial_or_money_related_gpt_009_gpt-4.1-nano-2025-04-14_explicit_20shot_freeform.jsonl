The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance and investments, which is a general pattern. The Generated rule explicitly mentions financial concepts, economic principles, and investment topics, which are closely aligned. While the phrasing differs—one being more general and the other slightly more detailed—they essentially identify the same key features and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly includes \"economic principles,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the Ground Truth, but this does not significantly alter the core concept. Therefore, they are very similar in their core logic, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
