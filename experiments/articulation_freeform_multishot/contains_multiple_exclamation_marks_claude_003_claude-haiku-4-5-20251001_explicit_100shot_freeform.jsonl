The generated rule classifies a text as True if it contains at least one word with an embedded or attached exclamation mark, which is a different pattern. Specifically, the generated rule does not account for multiple exclamation marks and focuses solely on the presence of a word containing `!`. As a result, they may produce different classifications: for example, a text with two standalone `!` marks but no words with embedded `!` would be True under the ground truth but False under the generated rule. Conversely, a text with a single word containing `!` would be True under the generated rule but may not meet the \"two or more exclamation marks\" criterion of the ground truth if no other `!` is present. Therefore, while related, they are not equivalent in logic or outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
