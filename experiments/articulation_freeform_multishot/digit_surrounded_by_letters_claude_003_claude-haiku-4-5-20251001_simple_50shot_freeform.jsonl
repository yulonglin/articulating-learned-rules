The generated rule, however, specifically looks for an alphanumeric code at the end of the input matching a pattern like a letter, digit, letter (e.g., \"y1y\"), and explicitly excludes inputs that follow a phrase like \"The year [number] was great,\" regardless of the year.\n\nWhile both rules involve patterns with a letter-digit-letter structure, the ground truth rule is more general, detecting any occurrence of a digit surrounded by letters anywhere in the text, not necessarily at the end. The generated rule is more specific, targeting only a pattern at the end and with a particular context (an alphanumeric code), and it explicitly excludes certain patterns.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual similarity—both involve patterns with a digit flanked by letters—but differ significantly in scope, pattern location, and context. They would not produce identical classifications on most inputs, especially those where the pattern appears in the middle of the text or in different contexts.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in their core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
