The Ground Truth specifies URLs beginning with \"http\" or \"www\" without further detail, implying any such pattern qualifies. The Generated Rule explicitly states \"http://\", \"https://\", or \"www.\" as indicators, which are common URL prefixes. They largely overlap in identifying URLs, but the generated rule explicitly includes \"https://\" (which is a subset of \"http\" in the ground truth) and specifies \"www.\" with a period, which may slightly narrow the pattern compared to the ground truth's broader \"www\" (which could be followed by other characters). Despite minor differences in phrasing and specificity, they are functionally very similar and would produce the same classifications on most inputs containing these URL patterns. Therefore, they are mostly equivalent with a high degree of overlap.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
