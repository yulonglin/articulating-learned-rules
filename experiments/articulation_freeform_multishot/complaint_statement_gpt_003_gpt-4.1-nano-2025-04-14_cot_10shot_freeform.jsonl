The Ground Truth Rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, which directly target negative evaluations. The Generated Rule describes a pattern where True examples involve negative experiences or issues, while False examples are positive or neutral, effectively capturing the same core concept.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule introduces a broader pattern recognition based on the overall tone and context (positive/neutral vs. negative), rather than explicitly focusing on the presence of dissatisfaction or criticism. This makes it slightly more flexible but also potentially less precise in cases where negative sentiment is implied rather than explicitly stated.\n\nOverall, they align closely in identifying negative versus positive/neutral content, but the Ground Truth is more direct and explicit, while the Generated Rule relies on a broader contextual pattern. This results in a high degree of overlap but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
