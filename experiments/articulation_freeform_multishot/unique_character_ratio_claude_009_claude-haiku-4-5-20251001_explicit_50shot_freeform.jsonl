It does not specify the nature of the repetition (whether it's a single word, character, or pattern), but focuses on character diversity as a proxy for repetition.\n\nThe generated rule explicitly states that TRUE corresponds to repetitive patterns, specifically a single word or character repeated multiple times (3+), regardless of other content. It emphasizes the pattern of repetition rather than character diversity per se.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify repetitive or low-variability text, they differ in scope and focus:  \n- The ground truth uses a statistical measure (character ratio) that can detect various forms of repetition or limited vocabulary, including repeated characters, words, or patterns that reduce diversity.  \n- The generated rule centers on explicit repetition of the same word or character, primarily at the phrase or word level, and considers the presence of meaningful, varied content as FALSE.\n\nThey overlap in identifying repetitive content as TRUE, but the ground truth rule is broader and more quantitative, potentially capturing cases the generated rule might miss (e.g., repetitive characters with high similarity but not exact repetition, or low diversity due to other factors). Conversely, the generated rule might classify some non-repetitive but low-diversity texts as FALSE if they contain varied vocabulary but are not truly repetitive.\n\nOverall, they share a conceptual core—detecting repetition—but differ in implementation and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
