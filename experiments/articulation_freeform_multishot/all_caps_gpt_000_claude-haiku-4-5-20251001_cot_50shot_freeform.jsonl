The ground truth explicitly states that the input is labeled True if all alphabetic characters are uppercase and there is at least one letter. The generated rule states that the input is classified as True if and only if all alphabetic characters are uppercase, which implicitly includes the presence of at least one letter (since if there were no alphabetic characters, the condition \"all alphabetic characters are uppercase\" would be vacuously true, but the phrase \"if and only if\" suggests the presence of at least one letter). \n\nThe only subtle difference is that the generated rule emphasizes the \"if and only if\" condition, which aligns with the ground truth's requirement of at least one letter. Therefore, they describe essentially the same classification logic, with very minor phrasing differences.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
