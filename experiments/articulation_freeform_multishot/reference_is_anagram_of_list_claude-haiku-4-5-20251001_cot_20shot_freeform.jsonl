The generated rule, however, specifies that only words that are anagrams of \"silent\" (or contain exactly the letters s, i, l, e, n, t) are accepted. These are different sets of words; \"listen\" is an anagram of \"silent,\" but \"below\" and \"study\" are not. Therefore, the core pattern of recognizing words as anagrams of specific, common words is only partially aligned—only \"listen\" and \"silent\" are equivalent in both rules. The generated rule is more restrictive and specific, focusing solely on \"silent,\" whereas the ground truth encompasses multiple different words. They do not identify the same key features or patterns broadly, and would not produce the same classifications on most inputs. The core concepts differ significantly, making their equivalence minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
