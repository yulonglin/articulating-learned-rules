The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which captures the core themes. The Generated rule specifies that texts discussing financial concepts, money management, banking systems, investment strategies, or economic principles are considered true, and explicitly states that unrelated personal activities or hobbies are false. \n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one is more general, the other more detailed—the core concepts are aligned. They both identify financial/economic content as positive and non-financial content as negative. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly mentions \"money management,\" \"banking systems,\" and \"economic principles,\" which are encompassed within the broader categories of the Ground Truth rule.\n\nTherefore, they would produce very similar classifications on most inputs, with only minor potential discrepancies in edge cases where the scope of \"topics related to finance\" might differ slightly. Overall, they are effectively equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
