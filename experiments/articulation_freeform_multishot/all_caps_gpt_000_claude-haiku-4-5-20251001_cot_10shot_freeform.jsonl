The generated rule specifies that all words must be in UPPERCASE for True, and all words in lowercase for False, focusing on word-level casing consistency. While both rules involve uppercase/lowercase conditions, the ground truth allows for mixed-case words as long as all characters are uppercase, whereas the generated rule requires entire words to be uniformly uppercase or lowercase. They share the core concept of uppercase/lowercase patterns but differ in scope and specific conditions, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
