The Ground Truth emphasizes first-person perspective and personal introspection, while the Generated rule focuses on the content being about internal states, feelings, or personal agency, and contrasts it with external facts or observations. They overlap significantly in identifying internal, subjective experiences as true cases and external, objective facts as false cases. However, the Ground Truth explicitly specifies the linguistic perspective (first-person pronouns), whereas the Generated rule emphasizes the nature of the content (inner world vs. external facts). This difference in emphasis means they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical in scope or phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
