The ground truth explicitly states \"reads the same forwards and backwards\" after ignoring spaces and case, which is the standard definition of a palindrome. The generated rule also states \"reads the same forwards and backwards when ignoring spaces and capitalization,\" which aligns closely with the ground truth. The only minor difference is that the generated rule explicitly mentions \"the output is True\" and \"False otherwise,\" but this does not change the core logic. Overall, they identify the same key pattern and would produce identical classifications on most inputs, making them effectively equivalent in their core concept.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
