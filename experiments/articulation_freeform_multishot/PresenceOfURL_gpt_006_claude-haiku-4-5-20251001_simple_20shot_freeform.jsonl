The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', focusing on these specific patterns. The Generated Rule broadens this to include website links like 'www.example.com' or 'http://test.org', which aligns with the key features of URL patterns. They share the core concept of detecting URLs, and in most cases, they would produce similar classifications. However, the Generated Rule's phrasing suggests a slightly broader scope, potentially including URLs with other protocols or formats not explicitly covered by the 'http' or 'www' starting patterns in the Ground Truth. Therefore, they are largely equivalent but not perfectly identical in scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
