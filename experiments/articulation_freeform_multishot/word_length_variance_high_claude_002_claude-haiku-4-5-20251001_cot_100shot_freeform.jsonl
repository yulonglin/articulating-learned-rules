The generated rule, however, centers on a specific syntactic pattern (\"I am [complex_word] [complex_word]\") with sophisticated words, implying a focus on lexical complexity and phrase structure rather than statistical variance in word lengths. While both rules aim to identify certain linguistic features, they do so based on fundamentally different criteria—one on quantitative distribution of word lengths, the other on syntactic and lexical patterns. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
