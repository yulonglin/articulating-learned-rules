The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if the text starts with \"Code:\" and the following number is greater than 100, focusing on a specific prefix and numerical threshold. These rules are based on different features: one on digit sequences anywhere in the text, the other on a specific label (\"Code:\") and a numerical comparison. They do not identify the same patterns and would produce different classifications for most inputs. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic or pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
