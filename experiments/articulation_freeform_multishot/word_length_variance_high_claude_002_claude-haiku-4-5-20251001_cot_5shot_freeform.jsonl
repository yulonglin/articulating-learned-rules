The generated rule classifies text as TRUE based on the presence of at least one word starting with a vowel, emphasizing initial letter patterns rather than length variability.\n\nThese rules focus on fundamentally different features: one on length distribution variance, the other on initial letter patterns. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently because a text could have highly variable word lengths without any words starting with vowels, or vice versa. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their core concepts are not equivalent.\n\nOverall, the two rules are conceptually different and would rarely, if ever, produce identical classifications, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
