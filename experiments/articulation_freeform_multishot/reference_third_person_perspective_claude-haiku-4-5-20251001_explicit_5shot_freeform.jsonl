The Generated Rule classifies texts based on whether they describe interpersonal interactions, emotions, or cognitive processes involving people, versus sensory, environmental, or physical phenomena.\n\nWhile both rules aim to distinguish human-centered, internal, or social content from purely sensory or environmental descriptions, they differ in key aspects:  \n- The Ground Truth rule explicitly relies on perspective (third-person narration), whereas the Generated rule focuses on content themes (interpersonal, emotional, cognitive vs. sensory/environmental).  \n- The Generated rule does not specify perspective, so it might classify texts that are human-centered but written in first-person or second-person perspectives as false, whereas the Ground Truth would classify them as true if they are third-person.\n\nMost inputs that are third-person narratives about human interactions or internal states will likely be classified similarly by both rules, leading to high overlap. However, some texts might be classified differently if, for example, a human-centered description is not written from a third-person perspective, or if a sensory/environmental description is indirectly related to human perception.\n\nOverall, they share core concepts—distinguishing human/internal content from sensory/environmental content—but differ in the explicit criteria used (perspective vs. thematic content). Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
