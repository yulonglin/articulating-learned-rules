It emphasizes the pattern of letter casing within a single word, focusing on the presence of a word with a specific alternating case pattern.\n\nThe Generated Rule states that the output is **True** if:\n- There is at least one word with mixed case (uppercase and lowercase combined, like \"TeXt\" or \"FuNcTiOn\")\n- AND there is at least one other distinct word (in any case) that is not purely lowercase\n\nIt also states the output is **False** if:\n- The input lacks a mixed-case word\n- Or contains only common lowercase words without sufficient variety\n\nWhile both rules require the presence of a \"mixed case\" word, the key difference lies in the pattern they specify:\n- The Ground Truth explicitly requires an alternating case pattern within a single word.\n- The Generated Rule broadly requires a mixed-case word (not necessarily alternating) and additionally demands the presence of another word that is not purely lowercase.\n\nThis means:\n- The Ground Truth is more specific about the pattern (alternating case).\n- The Generated Rule is more general about mixed case and adds an extra condition about another non-lowercase word.\n\nIn practice, they may produce similar results when the mixed-case word has an alternating pattern, but the Generated Rule could classify words with non-alternating mixed case (e.g., \"TeXt\") as valid, which the Ground Truth would not. Conversely, the Ground Truth's focus on the specific pattern may exclude some words that the Generated Rule considers valid.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not perfectly aligned in logic, pattern specificity, or classification criteria.\n\n---","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
