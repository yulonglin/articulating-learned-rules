The generated rule, however, centers on the presence of specific identifiers or codes (like flight or ticket numbers) and distinguishes them from temporal or general statements. These criteria are quite different: one is a quantitative pattern (digit-to-letter ratio), the other is a qualitative content type (presence of specific identifiers). While both may sometimes overlap—texts with many identifiers might also have high digit-to-letter ratios—they generally target different features and would rarely produce identical classifications. Therefore, they are largely different in core concept and likely to diverge in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
