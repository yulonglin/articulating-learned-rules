It does not consider specific words or patterns, only the distribution of word lengths.\n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on detecting a specific pattern (\"a an\" followed by two complex words) to classify as FALSE, and otherwise classifies as TRUE if the text contains primarily simple, common words, regardless of order or repetition. It focuses on specific patterns and vocabulary complexity rather than statistical properties of word lengths.\n\nThese rules are fundamentally different: one is based on a quantitative measure of word length distribution, the other on pattern matching and vocabulary simplicity. They do not identify the same features, and their classifications would often differ, especially in texts that do not contain the specific pattern or vocabulary targeted by the generated rule.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
