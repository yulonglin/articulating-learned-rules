The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the content conveying internal feelings. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the text must contain emotional or affective language describing internal feelings or reactions, and it clarifies that neutral observations or factual descriptions are classified as false. \n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one is more general and the other more detailed—the core concept of detecting emotional content is consistent. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes a list of emotional states and emphasizes affective language, whereas the Ground Truth is broader but essentially covers the same idea.\n\nThey would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially those clearly expressing emotions or neutral descriptions. However, the Generated Rule's explicit mention of affective language and specific emotional terms might lead to slight differences in borderline cases.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are equivalent, but the phrasing and specificity differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
