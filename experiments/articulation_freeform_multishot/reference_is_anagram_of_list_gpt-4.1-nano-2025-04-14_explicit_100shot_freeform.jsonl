The key pattern is that the words are anagrams of specific common words.  \n\nThe generated rule specifies that a text is classified as True only if it is an anagram of \"silent,\" which is a specific case of anagram matching. While \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams of each other, the ground truth encompasses multiple words (\"listen,\" \"below,\" \"study\") and their anagrams, not just \"silent.\"  \n\nTherefore, the core concept of identifying words via anagram relationships is similar, but the scope differs:  \n- The ground truth covers multiple words and their anagrams.  \n- The generated rule focuses solely on \"silent\" (and by extension, \"listen\" if considered).  \n\nThey do not produce the same classifications for most inputs, especially for words like \"below\" or \"study\" that are not anagrams of \"silent.\"  \n\nOverall, they share the core idea of using anagram detection but differ significantly in scope and specific patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
