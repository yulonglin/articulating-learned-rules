This focuses on exact letter arrangements and the concept of anagrams of particular words. The generated rule, however, classifies words based on containing all six specific letters (e, i, l, n, s, t), regardless of order or additional letters, which is a broader criterion. While the generated rule captures some words related to \"listen\" and similar words, it also includes words that contain all six letters but are not anagrams of the target words, and excludes some anagrams that might not contain all six letters (e.g., \"enlist\" contains all six, but \"silent\" is an anagram of \"listen\" and also contains all six). Overall, they share the core concept of letter-based similarity but differ in specificity and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
