This focuses on a specific pattern involving digits embedded within words, indicating a form of obfuscation or pattern recognition related to character placement.\n\nThe generated rule, however, broadly classifies texts as True if they contain any leetspeak or character substitutions within words, such as \"w1t\" or \"i0a,\" which involve replacing letters with similar-looking digits or characters. It considers a wider range of obfuscation techniques, not limited to digits surrounded by letters.\n\nWhile both rules aim to detect obfuscation or character substitution, the ground truth is more narrowly focused on digits embedded within words, whereas the generated rule encompasses a broader set of leetspeak patterns, including substitutions that do not necessarily involve digits or specific placement.\n\nMost texts that contain a digit surrounded by letters (e.g., \"a5b\") would be classified similarly by both rules, but the generated rule might classify texts with other forms of obfuscation (like \"w1t\") as True, even if they do not meet the specific pattern of the ground truth.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not fully equivalent in scope or pattern detection, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
