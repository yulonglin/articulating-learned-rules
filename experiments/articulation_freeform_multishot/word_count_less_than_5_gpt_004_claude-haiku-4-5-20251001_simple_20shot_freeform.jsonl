The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain 1-2 words and none of a specific set of forbidden words; otherwise, it outputs False. While both rules are based on input length, the generated rule is more restrictive (only 1-2 words) and adds an explicit forbidden words check, which is not present in the ground truth. They do not identify the same key features: the ground truth focuses solely on length, whereas the generated rule emphasizes very short inputs and the absence of certain words. Consequently, they would produce different classifications on many inputs, especially those with 3-4 words or containing forbidden words. The core concept of length-based classification is similar, but the specific conditions differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
