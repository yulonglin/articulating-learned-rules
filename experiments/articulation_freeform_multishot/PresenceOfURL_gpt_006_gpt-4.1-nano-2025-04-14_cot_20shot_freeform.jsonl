The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with \"http\" or \"www\" without further detail, while the Generated Rule explicitly mentions \"http://\", \"https://\", and \"www.\" substrings. They largely identify the same key features—presence of a URL pattern or \"www.\"—and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs. However, the generated rule's explicit mention of \"http://\", \"https://\", and \"www.\" (with the period) makes it slightly more precise, potentially capturing URLs with these exact prefixes. The ground truth's broader \"http\" or \"www\" could include variations not explicitly covered in the generated rule, and vice versa. Overall, their core concepts are equivalent, but minor differences in pattern specificity prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
