This means only sequences of length exactly 3 qualify; sequences of fewer or more digits do not.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, states that the input is labeled True if it contains a number with 3 or more digits, and False if fewer than 3 digits. This includes sequences of length 3, 4, 5, etc., not just exactly 3. Therefore, the generated rule is broader and would classify inputs with longer digit sequences as True, which the ground truth does not.  \n\nWhile both rules focus on the number of digits in a sequence, the key difference is the specificity: the ground truth is about exactly three digits, whereas the generated rule is about three or more digits. They do not identify the same key feature precisely, and their classifications would differ on inputs with longer digit sequences.  \n\nThus, they are similar in concept but not equivalent in logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
