The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of clear emotional states like happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the emotional content itself. The Generated Rule broadens this to include feelings and internal states such as despair and delight, and explicitly states that the text should indicate an emotional or subjective experience, which aligns with the core idea of expressing internal emotional states.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly mentions that texts describing external objects, physical descriptions, or neutral observations are labeled False, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the Ground Truth. The Ground Truth is somewhat more concise and focused solely on the presence of emotional states, whereas the Generated Rule provides a more detailed criterion and examples.\n\nOverall, the core concept—identifying texts that convey internal emotional or subjective states—is consistent between both rules. They would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs, especially those clearly expressing emotions. The main difference is the level of detail and explicitness in the generated rule, which accounts for a slight divergence.\n\nTherefore, the rules are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, but not perfectly identical in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
