In contrast, the generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains specific identifiers or codes (like phone numbers, ticket numbers, etc.), which are typically characterized by containing certain patterns or formats rather than a simple ratio of digits to letters. The generated rule emphasizes the presence of particular types of information (identifiers) rather than a quantitative ratio of characters. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and are based on different core concepts.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
