The Ground Truth emphasizes \"a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement,\" focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"feelings or sentiments\" and explicitly states that the true class involves describing internal emotional states, while false involves physical scenes, sensory observations, or actions without internal emotion.\n\nWhile the core concept—differentiating emotion/feeling expressions from physical or observational descriptions—is aligned, the phrasing differs. The Ground Truth specifies particular emotions, whereas the Generated Rule encompasses a broader range of feelings and sentiments, possibly including more subtle or implicit emotional expressions. Additionally, the Generated Rule explicitly mentions positive or negative sentiments, which is a slight expansion.\n\nOverall, they largely overlap in intent and classification logic but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
