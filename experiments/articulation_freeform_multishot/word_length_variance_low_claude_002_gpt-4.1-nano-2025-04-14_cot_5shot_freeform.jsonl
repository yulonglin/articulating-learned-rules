The generated rule classifies sentences as TRUE if they contain at least one repeated valid English word, focusing on word repetition and validity. These are fundamentally different features: one measures length distribution uniformity, the other relies on word repetition and validity. They do not identify the same patterns or key features, and they would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concepts—length variance versus word repetition—are not equivalent, making the rules largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
