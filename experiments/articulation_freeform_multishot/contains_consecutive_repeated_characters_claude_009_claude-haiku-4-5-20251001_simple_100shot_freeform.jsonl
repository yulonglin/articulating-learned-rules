The ground truth rule focuses on consecutive repeated characters (e.g., 'oo', 'ss'), capturing only immediate repetitions. The generated rule considers any duplicate letter anywhere in the word, regardless of position, which includes non-consecutive duplicates (e.g., 'data' with two 'a's). As a result, they agree on many cases—such as \"hello\" (both rules detect 'l' or 'l's) and \"python\" (no duplicates). However, they differ in some cases: the ground truth would not flag \"data\" (no consecutive repeats), but the generated rule would. Conversely, the ground truth would flag \"book\" (consecutive 'oo'), and the generated rule would as well. Overall, they are similar in concept but not identical in pattern detection, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
