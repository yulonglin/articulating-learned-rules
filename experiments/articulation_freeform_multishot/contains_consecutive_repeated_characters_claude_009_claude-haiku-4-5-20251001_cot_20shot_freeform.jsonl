The Ground Truth explicitly states the condition as \"any character appears two or more times consecutively,\" which aligns directly with the description of \"at least one pair of consecutive identical letters\" in the Generated Rule. The core concept—detecting consecutive repeated characters—is the same. The slight difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes the pattern occurring anywhere in the string, while the Generated Rule specifies the presence of at least one such pair. They would produce identical classifications on most inputs, with minimal room for divergence. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in logic, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
