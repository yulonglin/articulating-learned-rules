The generated rule, however, specifies particular phrases involving hearing or reporting (\"I heard \\\"Stop\\\"\") or specific statements (\"She told me \\\"Never\\\"\") as triggers, which are more concrete examples rather than structural patterns. While both rules involve quotations, the ground truth emphasizes nesting depth regardless of content, whereas the generated rule centers on specific content patterns. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., nested quotes involving reporting), but generally, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs, and their core concepts differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
