It emphasizes a quantitative, percentage-based threshold.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, centers on the presence of multiple or expressive punctuation marks (e.g., ellipses, multiple exclamation points, \"?!\") that convey emotion or emphasis, without referencing the overall punctuation proportion. It is more qualitative and context-dependent, considering the expressive intent behind punctuation rather than its frequency relative to total characters.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their core features differ: one is a numerical threshold, the other is pattern and intent-based. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., heavily punctuated texts likely to have high punctuation percentage), but they are not equivalent in logic or scope. Therefore, they would not necessarily produce the same classifications across all inputs, especially in edge cases where punctuation is used heavily but not proportionally, or vice versa.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are related but not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
