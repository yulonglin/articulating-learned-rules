The Ground Truth emphasizes first-person perspective (I, me, my, we, us), which is a strong indicator of internal reflection, whereas the Generated Rule focuses on the presence of emotional, introspective, or subjective content. While they largely overlap in identifying internal states, the Ground Truth's reliance on pronouns may lead to different classifications in cases where internal states are expressed without first-person pronouns, or external descriptions include first-person references. Conversely, the Generated Rule may classify some inputs as internal states based on emotional content even if they lack first-person pronouns. Overall, they share the core concept but differ slightly in the features they prioritize, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
