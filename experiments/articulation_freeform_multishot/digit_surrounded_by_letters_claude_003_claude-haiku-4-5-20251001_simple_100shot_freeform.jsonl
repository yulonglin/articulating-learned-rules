The generated rule, however, involves a more complex and different set of conditions: it classifies texts as True if they contain common words and end with a token that includes both letters and numbers, and False if the text matches a specific pattern about a year. These rules do not target the same features; the ground truth is about embedded digit-letter patterns, while the generated rule emphasizes the presence of certain words and token endings, with an exception for a particular pattern. They are not equivalent in core concept or pattern detection, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
