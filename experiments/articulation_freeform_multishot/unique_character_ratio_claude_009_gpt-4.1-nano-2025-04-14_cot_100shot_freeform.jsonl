The generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it is composed of repeated words or characters, emphasizing pattern repetition. While both rules focus on repetition, the ground truth centers on character diversity, whereas the generated rule emphasizes repeated patterns or words. They share a common theme of repetition but differ in scope: one is about character variety, the other about pattern repetition. Consequently, they may agree on many inputs involving repetitive characters but could diverge on texts with limited character variety but no pattern repetition, or vice versa. Therefore, they are related but not fully equivalent in their core concepts or classification outcomes.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
