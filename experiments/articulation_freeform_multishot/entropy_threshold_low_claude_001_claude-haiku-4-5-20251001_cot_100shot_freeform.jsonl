The generated rule, however, uses more qualitative criteria—presence of repetition, very short length, or simple exclamations—without explicitly measuring entropy. While both rules aim to identify predictable or simple content, the generated rule's focus on explicit repetition and short responses does not necessarily align perfectly with the entropy threshold. For example, a text with low entropy but no obvious repetition might be classified differently, and vice versa. Therefore, they share a conceptual goal but differ significantly in their specific features and likely classifications, resulting in a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
