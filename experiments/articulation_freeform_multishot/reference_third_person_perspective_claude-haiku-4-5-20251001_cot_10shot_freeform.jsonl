The Generated rule centers on the presence of human actions or interactions, regardless of grammatical perspective, and explicitly excludes descriptions focusing solely on objects, nature, or phenomena. While both rules aim to distinguish sentences involving humans from those that do not, they differ in key features: the Ground Truth relies on pronoun usage and perspective, whereas the Generated rule depends on the presence of human actions/interactions. As a result, they would often align but can diverge in cases where sentences describe humans without using third-person pronouns or describe actions without explicitly mentioning human agents. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
