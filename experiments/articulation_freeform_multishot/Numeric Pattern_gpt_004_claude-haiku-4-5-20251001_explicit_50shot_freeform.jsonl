It does not require any specific preceding words or phrases.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, requires the presence of the word \"Meeting\" immediately before or with the date, and only classifies as positive if both conditions are met. It also considers only dates in certain formats (\"Month Day, Year\", \"D/M/Year\", \"M/D/Year\") and explicitly states that single words or phrases without a date are negative.  \n\nWhile both rules focus on detecting dates, the generated rule introduces an additional contextual requirement (\"Meeting\") and restricts positive classification to cases where \"Meeting\" appears with a date. The ground truth rule does not consider context or specific words, only the presence of a date in certain formats.  \n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic. The generated rule is more restrictive and context-dependent, whereas the ground truth is solely based on date presence in specific formats. They would produce similar classifications only in cases where \"Meeting\" is always associated with dates, but generally, they differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
