The generated rule, however, specifically looks for a phrase \"Meeting on\" followed by a particular date pattern (\"Month Day, Year\") with exact formatting and no mention of other date formats or contexts. While both rules focus on detecting date patterns, the ground truth is broader, encompassing multiple date formats and contexts, whereas the generated rule is narrowly focused on a specific phrase and pattern. They would agree on some inputs containing \"Meeting on\" with the specified date format, but they would differ on many other cases, especially those with different date formats or without the phrase \"Meeting on.\" Therefore, they are not equivalent in scope or pattern detection, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
