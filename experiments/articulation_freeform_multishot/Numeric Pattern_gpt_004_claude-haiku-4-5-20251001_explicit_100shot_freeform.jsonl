The generated rule, however, specifies that the date must appear after the phrase \"Meeting on,\" and only considers dates in those formats following that phrase. Additionally, the generated rule emphasizes the presence of the phrase \"Meeting on\" as a prerequisite, which is not part of the ground truth. Therefore, while both rules focus on detecting specific date formats, they differ significantly in context sensitivity and scope. They would produce similar classifications only in cases where the date appears after \"Meeting on\" and no other date formats are present elsewhere, but they are not equivalent in general.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
