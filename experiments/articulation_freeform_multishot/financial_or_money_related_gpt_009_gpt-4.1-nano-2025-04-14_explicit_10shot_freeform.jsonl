The Ground Truth emphasizes topics \"related to finance, money, banking, or investments,\" which directly targets financial content. The Generated Rule broadens this to \"financial concepts, literacy, or banking systems\" and explicitly states non-financial topics like leisure activities or personal preferences as negatives. While the phrasing differs, the core pattern—identifying financial versus non-financial content—is similar. However, the generated rule's inclusion of \"literacy\" and \"banking systems\" adds some nuance, and its explicit mention of non-financial topics may lead to slight differences in classification, especially in edge cases. Overall, they largely align in identifying financial content but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
