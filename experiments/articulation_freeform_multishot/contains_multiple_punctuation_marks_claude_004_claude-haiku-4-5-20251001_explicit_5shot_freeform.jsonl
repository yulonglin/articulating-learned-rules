It focuses solely on the count and presence of these punctuation marks anywhere in the input.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies a text as True if it contains at least one special character embedded within or adjacent to words, emphasizing the placement of punctuation within words rather than the total count. It also considers the absence of embedded punctuation as a criterion for False, which is a different focus than counting total punctuation marks.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, the ground truth emphasizes the number and specific set of punctuation marks, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the embedding of punctuation within words and the presence of any such character. They do not necessarily produce the same classification for all inputs—e.g., a text with three punctuation marks scattered throughout but not embedded within words might be True under the ground truth but False under the generated rule.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual similarity in involving punctuation but differ significantly in the specific features they prioritize and how they determine classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
