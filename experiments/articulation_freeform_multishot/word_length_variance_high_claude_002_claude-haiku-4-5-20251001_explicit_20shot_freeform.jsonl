In contrast, the generated rule classifies as TRUE if there are at least two words longer than 10 characters, focusing on the presence of specific long words rather than the overall variability. While both rules tend to identify texts with notably long words, they do not necessarily align perfectly: the variance-based rule considers the entire distribution, potentially flagging texts with mixed short and long words, whereas the length-based rule only requires two long words, regardless of the rest. The examples show some overlap, but the core concepts differ—one measures distribution spread, the other counts long words. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
