In contrast, the generated rule describes a qualitative pattern: True cases are short, simple, and often single words or brief phrases, while False cases are longer and more complex. While both rules tend to classify very brief, straightforward texts as True and longer, more elaborate texts as False, they do not necessarily identify the same features. For example, a short phrase with high entropy (e.g., random characters) might be classified differently by the entropy rule but still be considered True by the generated rule if it is brief and simple. Conversely, some texts might have low entropy but be longer or more complex, leading to potential mismatches. Therefore, they are related in their general tendency but do not precisely describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
