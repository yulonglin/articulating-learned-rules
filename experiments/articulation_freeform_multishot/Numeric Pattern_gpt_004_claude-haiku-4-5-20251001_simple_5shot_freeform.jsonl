The generated rule only considers the presence of a date in the \"Month Day, Year\" format, ignoring the 'DD/MM/YYYY' pattern entirely. Additionally, the generated rule emphasizes the input being a date rather than the presence of a date pattern, and it seems to classify any input with \"Month Day, Year\" as positive, regardless of whether other date formats are present. Therefore, while there is some overlap—both rules recognize the \"Month Day, Year\" format—the generated rule does not account for the 'DD/MM/YYYY' pattern, and its focus differs slightly. They are similar but not equivalent in scope and key features identified.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
