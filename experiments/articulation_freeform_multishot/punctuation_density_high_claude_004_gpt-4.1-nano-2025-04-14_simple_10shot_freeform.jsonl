The generated rule classifies text as TRUE based on the presence of multiple consecutive exclamation or question marks, emphasizing specific punctuation patterns associated with strong emotion. While both involve punctuation, they target different features: the ground truth considers overall punctuation frequency, whereas the generated rule targets particular punctuation sequences. They may occasionally overlap if heavy punctuation usage includes repeated marks, but generally, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
