In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE solely if there is at least one very long word (longer than 10 characters). These criteria are fundamentally different: the first considers the distribution and spread of all word lengths, while the second focuses on the presence of a single long word. They may sometimes coincide—texts with very long words often have high variance—but they are not equivalent in core concept or in most cases. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications are unlikely to align consistently.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
