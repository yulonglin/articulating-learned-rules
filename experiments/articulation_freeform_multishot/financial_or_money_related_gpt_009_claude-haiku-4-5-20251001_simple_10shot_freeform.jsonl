The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which captures the core subject matter. The Generated rule explicitly lists financial concepts, money management, banking systems, investment strategies, and economic principles, and also clarifies that unrelated personal or lifestyle topics should be classified as false.\n\nWhile the core concept—identifying financial/economic content—is aligned, the Generated rule provides more detailed categories and explicitly excludes personal activities, hobbies, travel, or lifestyle topics. The Ground Truth rule is somewhat broader and less specific about what constitutes relevant topics.\n\nMost inputs discussing finance or economics would be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated rule's explicit exclusions and detailed categories might lead to slight differences in borderline cases. Overall, they describe similar classification logic with some differences in specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
