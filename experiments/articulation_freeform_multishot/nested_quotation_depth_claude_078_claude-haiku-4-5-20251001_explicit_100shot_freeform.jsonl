The Ground Truth explicitly states the presence of quotes nested at least two levels deep, exemplified by phrases like 'He said \"She told me \\\"No\\\"\"', emphasizing the depth of nesting. The Generated Rule also centers on nested quotation marks, indicated by `\\\"`, and associates this with reported speech or indirect quotation, which aligns with the idea of nested quotes.\n\nHowever, the Generated Rule simplifies the concept by focusing solely on the presence of nested `\\\"` marks and does not explicitly specify the depth (i.e., at least two levels). It also mentions that a single-level quote (no nesting) should be classified as false, which is consistent with the Ground Truth's intent.\n\nThe main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes the depth of nesting (minimum two levels), while the Generated Rule broadly considers any nested `\\\"` as indicative of nested quotes, potentially including cases with only one level of nesting. Despite this, in typical usage, both rules would largely agree on most inputs, especially those with clear nesting at or beyond two levels.\n\nTherefore, they describe similar core concepts and would produce similar classifications in most cases, but the explicit depth requirement in the Ground Truth makes them not perfectly aligned.\n\nOverall, a score of 8 reflects that they are closely aligned but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
