While both rules aim to identify URLs, the ground truth is more inclusive of URLs starting with \"www\" (which may or may not be followed by \"http\") and less precise about URL structure, whereas the generated rule is more specific about URL prefixes. They share the core concept of detecting URLs, but differ in key features and patterns they recognize, leading to potential discrepancies in classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
