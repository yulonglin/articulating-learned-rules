The ground truth explicitly states that the text must contain at least one palindrome, while the generated rule refines this to require at least two palindromic words for a True classification. This subtle difference means that in cases where only one palindrome appears, the ground truth would classify as True, but the generated rule would classify as False, leading to some divergence.  \n\nDespite this, the core concept—identifying palindromic words—is consistent between the two rules. The generated rule's emphasis on multiple palindromes aligns closely with the idea of detecting palindromic content, making their overall logic highly similar. Therefore, they are largely equivalent in intent and effect, with a minor difference in the threshold for classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5777777777777777,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":45,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":5,"accuracy":0.5777777777777777},"parse_error":false}
