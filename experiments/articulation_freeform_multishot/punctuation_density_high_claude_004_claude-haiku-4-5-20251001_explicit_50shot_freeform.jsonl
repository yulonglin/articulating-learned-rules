The generated rule, however, emphasizes specific patterns of punctuation usage—multiple punctuation marks used together, sequences, or unconventional/emphatic punctuation—without considering the overall proportion. While both rules target \"heavy\" or \"unusual\" punctuation, the ground truth is a numerical threshold, whereas the generated rule is pattern-based. They overlap in identifying texts with prominent or emphatic punctuation, but the generated rule may classify texts with heavy but evenly distributed punctuation (below 15%) as FALSE, whereas the ground truth might classify them as TRUE if the proportion exceeds 15%. Conversely, texts with high punctuation proportion but conventional usage might be classified differently. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in logic or scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
