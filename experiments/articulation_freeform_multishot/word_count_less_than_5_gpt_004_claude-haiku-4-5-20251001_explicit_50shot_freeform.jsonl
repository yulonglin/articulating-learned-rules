The generated rule classifies texts as True only if they contain exactly 1 or 2 words, with no repeated words. This means:  \n- The ground truth accepts texts with 3 or 4 words, which the generated rule rejects.  \n- The generated rule accepts only 1 or 2 words, and additionally requires no repeated words, which is not a criterion in the ground truth.  \n- The core concept of \"fewer than 5 words\" is broader than \"exactly 1 or 2 words\" with no repetitions.  \n- They do not identify the same key features or patterns; the generated rule is more restrictive and specific.  \n- Therefore, they do not produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially for texts with 3 or 4 words.  \n\nOverall, while both rules focus on word count, their criteria differ significantly, making them only loosely related in concept.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
