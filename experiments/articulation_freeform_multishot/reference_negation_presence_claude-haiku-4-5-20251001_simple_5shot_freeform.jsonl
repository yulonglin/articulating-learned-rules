The generated rule, however, classifies a text based solely on whether all words are unique or if any word is repeated, which is unrelated to negation or the presence of negation words. These rules target entirely different features: one targets negation cues, the other word repetition. They do not identify the same key patterns and would rarely produce the same classifications, making their core concepts fundamentally different.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
