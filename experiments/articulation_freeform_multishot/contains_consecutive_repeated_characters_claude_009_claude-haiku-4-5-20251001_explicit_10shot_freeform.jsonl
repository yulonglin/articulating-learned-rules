The ground truth rule focuses specifically on consecutive repeated characters (e.g., 'oo', 'ss'), capturing local adjacency. The generated rule considers any repeated character anywhere in the string, regardless of whether the repetitions are consecutive, thus capturing a broader pattern.  \n\nIn many cases, these rules will agree—if a string has consecutive duplicates, it necessarily has repeated characters overall, and vice versa. However, they diverge in cases where repeated characters are non-consecutive (e.g., \"abcba\" has repeated 'a' and 'b' but no consecutive duplicates). The generated rule would classify \"abcba\" as True, while the ground truth rule would classify it as False.  \n\nTherefore, while they are similar in intent, they are not perfectly equivalent. The core concept of detecting repeated characters is shared, but the specific pattern (consecutive vs. any position) differs, leading to some classification discrepancies.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
