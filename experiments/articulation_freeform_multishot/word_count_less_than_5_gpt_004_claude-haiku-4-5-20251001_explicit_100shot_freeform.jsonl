The generated rule, however, classifies inputs as True only if they contain 1-2 words and do not include any forbidden words; it classifies all other inputs as False, including those with 3-4 words. This means the generated rule excludes many inputs with 3-4 words from being classified as True, whereas the ground truth would classify them as True. Additionally, the generated rule's reliance on a forbidden word list and specific word count constraints introduces a different pattern than simply counting words. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, would not produce identical classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
