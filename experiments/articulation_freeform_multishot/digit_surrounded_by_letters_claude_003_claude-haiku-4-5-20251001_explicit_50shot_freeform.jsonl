The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text contains at least one such digit with a letter immediately before and after it, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's description of a pattern of a letter, then a digit, then a letter. The main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of such a pattern somewhere in the text, while the Generated Rule specifies the pattern as a criterion for classification, with an example pattern and a note that absence typically relates to year-related texts. Overall, they target the same core pattern, making their classification logic largely equivalent, though phrasing and emphasis differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
