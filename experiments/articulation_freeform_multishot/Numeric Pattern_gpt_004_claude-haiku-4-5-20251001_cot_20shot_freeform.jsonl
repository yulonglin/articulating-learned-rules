The generated rule, however, classifies inputs as positive only if they contain the word \"Meeting\" followed by a date in any recognizable format, which introduces a contextual requirement not present in the ground truth. While both rules focus on detecting dates, the generated rule emphasizes a specific phrase (\"Meeting\") and a broader notion of \"any recognizable date format,\" making their key features and patterns different. They would not produce the same classifications consistently, especially in cases where dates appear without the word \"Meeting\" or in formats not recognized by the generated rule. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concepts or likely outcomes.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
