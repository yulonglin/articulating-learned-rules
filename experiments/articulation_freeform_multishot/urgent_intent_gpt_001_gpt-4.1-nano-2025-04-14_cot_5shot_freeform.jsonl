The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the intent and immediacy. The Generated Rule broadens this to include explicit references to emergency, urgent need, or critical situations, with examples like \"medical aid,\" \"urgent request,\" or \"evacuate.\" While the phrasing differs, both rules center on detecting language that signals urgency or emergency.\n\nThey largely overlap in identifying key features—namely, urgent or emergency-related language—and would likely classify most similar cases identically. However, the Ground Truth is slightly more general and less explicitly tied to specific keywords, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly mentions certain phrases and concepts. This slight difference in phrasing and scope accounts for the minor discrepancy, preventing a perfect score.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are equivalent, and the classification logic aligns closely, but the differences in phrasing and emphasis prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
