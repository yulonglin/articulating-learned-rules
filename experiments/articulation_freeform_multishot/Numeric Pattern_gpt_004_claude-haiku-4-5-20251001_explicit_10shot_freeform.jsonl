The ground truth specifies two explicit date formats: 'DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year', focusing on these specific patterns. The generated rule states \"any recognizable format\" such as those two, which broadens the scope to include other date formats not explicitly listed. While they share the core concept of detecting dates, the generated rule's broader phrasing may lead to different classifications on inputs with non-standard or less common date formats. Overall, they are similar in intent and key features but differ slightly in specificity, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
