The generated rule adds additional conditions: the URL must start with \"http://\", \"https://\", or \"www.\", and the input must also contain at least one of the words \"check,\" \"function,\" \"result,\" or \"the\". This makes the generated rule more restrictive and context-dependent. While both rules focus on URLs, the generated rule incorporates extra textual conditions, leading to potential differences in classification. They share the core idea of identifying URLs, but the added constraints mean they are not equivalent in logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
