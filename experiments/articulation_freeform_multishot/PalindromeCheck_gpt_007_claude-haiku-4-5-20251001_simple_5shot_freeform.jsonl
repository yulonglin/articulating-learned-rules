The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the generated rule extends this to punctuation as well. Despite this slight difference, the core concept—identifying palindromes—is the same, and they would produce identical classifications on most inputs that contain only spaces and case differences. The main discrepancy is that the generated rule considers punctuation, which the ground truth does not explicitly mention. Overall, they are very similar in intent and key features, but not perfectly aligned due to this minor difference.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
