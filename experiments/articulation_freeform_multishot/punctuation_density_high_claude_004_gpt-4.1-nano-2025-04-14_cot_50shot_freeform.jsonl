The generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of multiple punctuation marks or expressive interjections indicating strong emotion or surprise, which is more qualitative and pattern-based. While both rules relate to punctuation, the ground truth centers on a specific proportion threshold, whereas the generated rule looks for particular punctuation patterns and expressive elements. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., texts with heavy punctuation), but they do not fully align in their core logic or criteria. Therefore, they are only partially equivalent and would not necessarily produce identical classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
