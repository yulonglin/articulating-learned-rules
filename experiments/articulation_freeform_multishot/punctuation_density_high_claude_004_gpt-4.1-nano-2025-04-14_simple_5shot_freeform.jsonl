It focuses solely on the quantitative feature—punctuation percentage—without regard to the words or expressions used. The generated rule, however, centers on detecting specific expressions of surprise, confusion, or hesitation (like \"wait,\" \"hmm,\" etc.) and their typical punctuation patterns, which is a semantic and lexical approach. These rules are fundamentally different: one is pattern-based on punctuation density, the other on lexical cues indicating emotional states. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, as they target different features and concepts.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
