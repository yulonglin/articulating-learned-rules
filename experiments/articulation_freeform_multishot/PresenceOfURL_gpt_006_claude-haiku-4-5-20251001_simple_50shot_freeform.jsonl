The Ground Truth explicitly states URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', which covers common URL schemes and subdomains. The Generated Rule broadens this slightly by including patterns like `https://`, `http://`, and `www.`, which are typical URL indicators. \n\nThey largely identify the same key features—presence of a URL pattern—though the Generated Rule explicitly mentions `https://` and `http://`, which are common URL schemes, and emphasizes matching patterns like `www.`. The core concept of detecting URLs remains consistent, and in most cases, they would produce the same classification.\n\nHowever, the Ground Truth's wording is slightly less explicit about URL schemes and subdomains, and the Generated Rule explicitly mentions matching patterns like `https://` and `www.`, which could lead to minor differences in edge cases. Overall, the core logic aligns closely, but the slight difference in pattern specificity accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
