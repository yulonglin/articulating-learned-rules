It focuses solely on explicit negation indicators.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on detecting contractions (like \"can't,\" \"don't,\" \"won't\") or multiple occurrences of specific programming/action words (e.g., \"run,\" \"text,\" \"output,\" \"function,\" \"testing,\" \"python,\" \"hello,\" \"no,\" \"never,\" \"not\"). It also considers the presence of certain high-indicator words and their frequency, not just negation.  \n\nWhile there is some overlap—both rules recognize \"no,\" \"never,\" \"not,\" and contractions—they differ significantly in scope and focus. The ground truth rule is straightforward and solely negation-based, whereas the generated rule incorporates a broader set of keywords and frequency considerations, which may lead to different classifications in many cases.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns comprehensively, and their classification outputs would often diverge. The core concept of negation detection is present in both but not equivalent in implementation or coverage.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
