It focuses exclusively on the presence of negation words as indicators of negativity.\n\nThe generated rule, however, is much broader and more complex. It considers contractions (e.g., \"won't,\" \"can't,\" \"don't\") as triggers, which often overlap with negation but also include other contractions not necessarily indicating negation. Additionally, it triggers classification based on the presence of certain key words, and notably, it requires multiple instances of trigger words or specific combinations, which is not part of the ground truth rule.\n\nBecause the generated rule includes many features beyond simple negation words—such as contractions, specific key words, and combinations—it can produce classifications that differ significantly from the ground truth. For example, it might classify texts as negative based on the presence of \"hello\" or \"output,\" which are not negation words, or fail to classify as negative if negation words are absent but other trigger words are present.\n\nOverall, the core concept of the ground truth rule is narrowly focused on negation words, while the generated rule encompasses a broader set of patterns, making them only loosely related. They do not identify the same key features, and their classifications will often differ.\n\nHence, the score reflects that they are only minimally aligned in intent and pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.48,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":24,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.48},"parse_error":false}
