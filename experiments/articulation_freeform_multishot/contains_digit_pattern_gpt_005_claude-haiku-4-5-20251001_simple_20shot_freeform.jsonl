The generated rule, however, labels inputs as True if they contain any digit ≥ 3 anywhere in the number, and False if all digits are between 0-2, regardless of sequence or length. These rules are fundamentally different: one looks for a specific consecutive pattern of length three, while the other looks for the presence of digits in a certain range. They do not identify the same features or patterns, and would rarely produce the same classification on the same input. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
