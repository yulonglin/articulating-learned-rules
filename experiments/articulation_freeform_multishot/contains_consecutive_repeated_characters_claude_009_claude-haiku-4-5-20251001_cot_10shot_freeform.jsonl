The ground truth emphasizes \"any character appears two or more times consecutively,\" which aligns with the idea of \"any pair of consecutive identical letters.\" The generated rule explicitly states \"contains at least one pair of consecutive identical letters,\" which is essentially the same pattern. The main difference is in phrasing: the ground truth refers broadly to any character repeated consecutively, while the generated rule specifies \"double letters.\" They identify the same key feature and would produce identical classifications in most cases. The slight difference in wording does not affect the core logic, making them effectively equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
