The Ground Truth specifies \"a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement,\" focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any emotional or feeling expression, positive or negative, and explicitly states that neutral observations, sensory details, or physical actions without emotional content should be classified as False. While the core concept—detecting emotional states—is aligned, the Generated Rule explicitly includes both positive and negative feelings and clarifies what is excluded, making it slightly more comprehensive. The main difference is the phrasing and slight expansion in scope, but overall, they describe very similar classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
