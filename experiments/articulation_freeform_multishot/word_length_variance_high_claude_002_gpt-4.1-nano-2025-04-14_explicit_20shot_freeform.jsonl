In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as True based on the presence of specific \"positive\" words, regardless of their length or distribution. These rules are fundamentally different: one relies on a quantitative measure of word length variability, while the other depends on the occurrence of certain keywords. They do not identify the same features or patterns, and their classifications are unlikely to align consistently across inputs. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or behavior, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
