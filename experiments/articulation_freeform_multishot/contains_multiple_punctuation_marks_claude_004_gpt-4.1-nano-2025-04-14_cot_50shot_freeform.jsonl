The generated rule classifies an input as True if it contains at least one fully alphabetic word, regardless of punctuation count. While both rules aim to determine some aspect of the input's content, they rely on different key features: one on punctuation frequency, the other on the presence of a \"clean\" word.  \n\nThey may produce similar classifications in some cases—e.g., inputs with many punctuation marks often contain no fully alphabetic words, and inputs with a fully alphabetic word may or may not have enough punctuation to meet the ground truth threshold. However, they are not equivalent in core logic: the ground truth emphasizes punctuation count, while the generated rule emphasizes the presence of a fully alphabetic word. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification criteria, leading to only partial overlap in their outputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.3,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":15,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.3},"parse_error":false}
