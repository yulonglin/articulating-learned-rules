This suggests a broad pattern: words that are anagrams of certain common words. In contrast, the generated rule specifically checks if a word is an anagram of \"silent,\" which is only one of the possible common words and does not encompass the others (\"listen,\" \"below,\" \"study\"). Therefore, the core concept of identifying anagrams is shared, but the specific pattern (matching any of several common words vs. only \"silent\") differs significantly. They do not produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially for words that are anagrams of \"listen,\" \"below,\" or \"study\" but not \"silent.\" Overall, the core idea of recognizing anagrams is similar, but the scope and key features differ, leading to a low equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
