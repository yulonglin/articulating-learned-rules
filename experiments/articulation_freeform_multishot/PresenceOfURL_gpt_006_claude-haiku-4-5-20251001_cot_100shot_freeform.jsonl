The ground truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', which captures common URL patterns. The generated rule broadens this to include patterns like \"https://\", \"http://\", or \"www.\", explicitly mentioning typical URL prefixes. While the core concept—detecting URLs—is the same, the generated rule explicitly includes \"https://\" and \"http://\", which are not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth but are implied by \"http\" patterns. The phrasing differs slightly, but the key features are aligned. They would produce identical classifications on most inputs containing these URL patterns, though the generated rule is slightly more explicit and comprehensive. Therefore, they are largely equivalent with minor differences in phrasing and pattern specification.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
