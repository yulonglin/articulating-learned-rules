In contrast, the generated rule considers qualitative features such as the presence of multiple punctuation marks (especially specific patterns like \"...\", \"!!!\", \"???\"), emotional or hesitation markers, quoted speech with punctuation, and combinations indicating internal conflict or emotional intensity. While both rules recognize that punctuation and emotional cues are important, the generated rule incorporates contextual and pattern-based features beyond mere percentage thresholds. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap regarding punctuation and emotional markers but differ significantly in their specific criteria and scope. They are not equivalent in logic or implementation, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
