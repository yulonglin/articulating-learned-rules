The Ground Truth specifies \"words where letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase,\" which is a stricter pattern (e.g., \"aBcDeF\") than simply containing both uppercase and lowercase letters. The Generated Rule states \"words with mixed case (both uppercase and lowercase letters),\" which aligns with the core concept of containing both cases, regardless of the exact pattern of alternation.\n\nThe main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes a specific alternating pattern, while the Generated Rule considers any word with both uppercase and lowercase letters as sufficient. In most practical cases, these criteria overlap significantly because words with alternating case will also contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the core concept—detecting words that are not uniformly cased—is effectively the same, making the rules nearly equivalent in intent and outcome. The slight difference in pattern specificity accounts for the score of 9 rather than 10.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
