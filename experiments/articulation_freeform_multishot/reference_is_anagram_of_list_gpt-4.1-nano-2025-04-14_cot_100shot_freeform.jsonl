The generated rule, however, restricts classification to only words that are anagrams of \"silent,\" which is a single specific anagram group. While \"silent\" is an anagram of \"listen,\" the ground truth includes \"listen\" (which is an anagram of \"silent\") but also \"below\" and \"study,\" which are not anagrams of \"silent.\" Therefore, the core concept of identifying words as anagrams of certain reference words is similar, but the specific sets differ. They would produce the same classification only for words related to \"silent\"/\"listen,\" but diverge for \"below\" and \"study.\" Overall, they share the idea of recognizing anagrams but differ in scope and specific patterns, leading to partial equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
