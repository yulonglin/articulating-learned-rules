The generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence or absence of specific short, common words versus long or complex words, focusing on vocabulary rather than word length distribution. While both rules relate to word characteristics, they target different features: one measures statistical variation in word lengths, the other relies on specific word content. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and do not share core concepts.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
