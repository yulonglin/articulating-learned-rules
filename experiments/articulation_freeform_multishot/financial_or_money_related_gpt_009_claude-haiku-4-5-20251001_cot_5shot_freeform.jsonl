The generated rule broadens this to include \"abstract economic, financial, or systemic concepts/phenomena\" and explicitly excludes personal experiences, activities, or preferences. While there is some overlap—both rules aim to identify discussions related to finance/economics—the generated rule introduces a more abstract and systemic perspective, potentially capturing a wider range of topics. Conversely, the ground truth rule is more narrowly focused on specific financial topics. Therefore, they do not identify exactly the same key features, and their classifications may differ on certain inputs, especially those involving systemic or abstract economic concepts not directly tied to the specific topics in the ground truth.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
