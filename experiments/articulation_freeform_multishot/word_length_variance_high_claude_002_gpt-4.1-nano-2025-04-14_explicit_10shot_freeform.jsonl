This is a quantitative, distribution-based criterion focusing on the structural characteristic of the text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies texts based on the presence or absence of certain semantically meaningful words related to sophistication, communication, or international concepts. It relies on lexical content and semantic categories rather than structural or statistical properties.\n\nThese rules do not identify the same key features or patterns:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes word length variability, regardless of word meaning.  \n- The generated rule emphasizes the presence of specific meaningful words, regardless of their length distribution.\n\nThey are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs because a text could have high variance in word lengths without containing any of the specified meaningful words, or vice versa. The core concepts—statistical structural property versus semantic content—are fundamentally different.\n\nTherefore, they are not equivalent in logic or approach, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
