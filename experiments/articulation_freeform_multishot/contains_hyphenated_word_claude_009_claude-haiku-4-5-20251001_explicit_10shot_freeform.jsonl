The generated rule, however, relies on counting the number of words from a specific set, requiring at least 3 such words for classification as True. While both rules aim to identify certain indicative features, they target different patterns: the ground truth emphasizes hyphenated words, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the frequency of specific keywords. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ, especially in texts lacking multiple keywords but containing hyphenated words, or vice versa. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic or outcome, resulting in a relatively low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5306122448979592,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.5306122448979592},"parse_error":false}
