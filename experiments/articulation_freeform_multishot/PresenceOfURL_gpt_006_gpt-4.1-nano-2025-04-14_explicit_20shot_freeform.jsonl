The Ground Truth specifies \"http\" or \"www\" at the start of the URL, implying the URL begins with these prefixes. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the URL must start with \"http://\", \"https://\", or \"www.\"—which are more precise and standard URL prefixes.  \n\nThey largely identify the same key features: presence of a URL starting with \"http\" or \"www\". However, the Ground Truth's description is slightly less specific about the exact URL format, potentially allowing for variations (e.g., \"http\" or \"www\" anywhere in the URL, not necessarily at the start). The Generated Rule explicitly requires the URL to start with the specified prefixes, making it more precise.  \n\nMost inputs containing URLs starting with these prefixes would be classified similarly by both rules, but the slight difference in specificity means they are not perfectly equivalent. Overall, they are very similar in intent and outcome, hence a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
