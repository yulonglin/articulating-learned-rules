The generated rule, however, requires at least one punctuation mark *and* the presence of a specific set of keywords, which is a different pattern. It emphasizes the combination of punctuation with particular words, rather than the count of punctuation marks alone. These criteria are not equivalent: the ground truth can classify inputs with many punctuation marks regardless of keywords, while the generated rule depends on both punctuation and keyword presence. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would often differ.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
