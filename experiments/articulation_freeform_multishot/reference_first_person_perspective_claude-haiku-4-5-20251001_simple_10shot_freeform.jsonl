The Generated Rule focuses on whether the statement expresses a personal emotional experience, internal feeling, or subjective state, and distinguishes these from external events or observations. While both rules aim to identify subjective, internal content, the Ground Truth centers on linguistic features (first-person pronouns), whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the nature of the content (emotional/internal vs. external). They largely overlap in identifying internal, subjective statements but differ in approach: one is about perspective (linguistic markers), the other about content (emotional/internal state). Therefore, they would produce similar classifications in many cases but are not perfectly aligned, especially in edge cases where first-person pronouns are used for external descriptions or when internal states are described without explicit pronouns.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
