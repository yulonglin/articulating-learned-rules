It relies on a measurable pattern involving character types and their proportions.  \n\nThe generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains a specific, concrete identifier or reference number, emphasizing the presence of a complete, unique ID. It does not consider the overall character composition or ratios but focuses on the existence of particular types of information (identifiers).  \n\nWhile both rules aim to identify \"numerical content\" or \"identifiers,\" their core features differ: one is ratio-based and pattern-focused, the other is content-specific and identifier-focused. They would rarely produce the same classification on the same input, especially if the text contains numerical data without explicit identifiers or identifiers without a high digit-to-letter ratio.  \n\nTherefore, the core concepts are not equivalent, and their classification logic is quite different.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
