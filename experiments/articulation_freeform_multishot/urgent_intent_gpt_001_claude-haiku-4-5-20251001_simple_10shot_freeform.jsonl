The Ground Truth emphasizes a general indication of urgent requests or calls for immediate action, without specifying the nature of the emergency. The Generated Rule narrows this to life-threatening or critical situations, explicitly mentioning medical emergencies, hazardous conditions, or rescue scenarios. While there is significant overlap—both aim to detect urgent, action-requiring messages—the Generated Rule introduces a more specific subset of emergencies, potentially excluding some urgent but non-life-threatening requests covered by the Ground Truth. Therefore, they largely align but are not perfectly equivalent, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
