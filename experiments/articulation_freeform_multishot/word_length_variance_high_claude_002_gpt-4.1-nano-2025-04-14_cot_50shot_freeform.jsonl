In contrast, the generated rule relies on specific lexical features—presence of \"I\" and \"am\" and at least one long word (>3 letters)—to determine classification. While both rules aim to identify \"inconsistent\" or \"complex\" word patterns, they do so via different features: one via statistical variance in word lengths, the other via particular words and the presence of long words. They do not necessarily identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications may diverge on many inputs. The core concepts are related to word length and complexity but are expressed differently, leading to only partial overlap in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
