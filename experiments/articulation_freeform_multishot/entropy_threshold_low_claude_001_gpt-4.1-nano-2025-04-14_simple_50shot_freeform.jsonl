The generated rule, however, explicitly checks for specific character sets (lowercase letters, digits, certain short expressions) or repetitive/punctuation-only strings, which can produce low entropy but also includes explicit pattern-based criteria. While both rules tend to identify predictable or simple strings, the generated rule is more prescriptive about content types, whereas the ground truth relies solely on entropy measurement. They overlap in identifying repetitive or predictable patterns but differ in scope and specificity, leading to partial but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
