The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which is a broad but clear indicator of urgency. The Generated Rule specifies that true cases contain explicit emergency-related language (e.g., \"immediately,\" \"evacuate,\" \"call for backup,\" \"hazard,\" \"medical aid,\" \"collapse\") and that false cases lack such cues, being more casual or neutral.\n\nThey largely align in identifying the same core pattern: the presence of urgent, emergency-related language indicating immediate danger or need for rapid response. The main difference is that the Generated Rule provides specific keywords and examples, making it more detailed, while the Ground Truth is more general.\n\nMost inputs that contain explicit emergency language will be classified similarly by both rules, and both focus on detecting urgent requests or calls for immediate action. The slight difference in specificity accounts for the high but not perfect score.\n\nTherefore, they describe similar classification logic with minor differences in phrasing and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
