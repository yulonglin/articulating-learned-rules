The generated rule, however, centers on the presence of programming keywords or terms within the input, indicating a code-related context, and does not explicitly consider digit placement or patterns. While both rules may sometimes classify similar inputs—e.g., code snippets containing digits and keywords—they fundamentally target different features: one looks for specific character arrangements involving digits, the other for programming-related words. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.52,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.52},"parse_error":false}
