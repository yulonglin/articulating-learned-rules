The generated rule, however, targets the presence of specific formatted identifiers or codes (like tracking numbers, phone numbers, or time in HH:MM format) and excludes relative time references or general scores/durations. While both rules involve numeric content, the ground truth emphasizes a global ratio, whereas the generated rule emphasizes particular patterns or formats. They do not identify the same key features or patterns and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs.
