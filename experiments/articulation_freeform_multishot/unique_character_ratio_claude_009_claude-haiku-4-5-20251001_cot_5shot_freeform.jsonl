The generated rule, however, specifically targets inputs that are composed of a single repeated character (with spaces as separators), and classifies anything with multiple different characters or meaningful words as FALSE. While both rules aim to identify repetitive or low-variety inputs, the ground truth rule is broader, encompassing any text with low character diversity, including potentially short words or patterns with limited variation, not necessarily just a single repeated character. The generated rule is more restrictive, focusing solely on uniform repetition of one character, and explicitly excludes recognizable language content. Therefore, they share a core concept of low character diversity but differ significantly in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
