The Ground Truth Rule specifies topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on subject matter. The Generated Rule broadens this to include economic and investment concepts and explicitly states that non-financial topics like hobbies or leisure are classified as false, which aligns with the Ground Truth's focus. However, the Generated Rule emphasizes principles and concepts, potentially capturing a slightly wider or different set of texts, and the phrasing suggests a more explicit inclusion of economic ideas. While largely overlapping, subtle differences in phrasing and scope mean they are not perfectly aligned, but they are close enough to be considered largely equivalent in intent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
