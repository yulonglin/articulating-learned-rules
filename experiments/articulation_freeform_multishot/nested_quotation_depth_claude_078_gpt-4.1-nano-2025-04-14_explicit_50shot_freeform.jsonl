It emphasizes the structural pattern of nested quotations regardless of their content. In contrast, the generated rule specifies a particular content pattern: a quotation containing the word \"Never\" within certain attribution phrases (\"She\", \"She replied\", \"The report stated\"). It requires the presence of \"Never\" and specific attribution contexts, which are not part of the ground truth. Therefore, the two rules differ significantly in key features: one centers on nesting depth, the other on specific content within quotations and attribution phrases. They would not necessarily produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially if the nested quotations do not contain \"Never\" or are not associated with the specified attributions. The core concepts are not equivalent, making the rules largely different in logic and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
