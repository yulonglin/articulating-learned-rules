The ground truth explicitly states to ignore spaces and case, and to check if the string reads the same forwards and backwards. The generated rule states that the input contains a palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward), which aligns with the core concept of identifying palindromic sequences. \n\nHowever, the generated rule's phrasing \"contains a palindrome\" could imply that only a substring needs to be a palindrome, whereas the ground truth seems to require the entire string (minus spaces and case) to be a palindrome. If the generated rule is interpreted strictly as checking for the entire string, then they are equivalent. If \"contains a palindrome\" allows for partial matches, then there could be differences.\n\nOverall, they describe very similar classification logic, with minor potential ambiguity, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
