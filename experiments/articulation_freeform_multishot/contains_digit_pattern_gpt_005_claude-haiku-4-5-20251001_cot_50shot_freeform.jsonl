The generated rule, however, classifies inputs based on specific prefixes (\"Version\", \"Number\", \"Code:\") or a particular pattern (\"ID:\" followed by a 3-digit number). These criteria are quite different: the ground truth is pattern-based on digit sequences, while the generated rule is pattern-based on specific prefixes and a particular \"ID:\" format. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and would rarely produce the same classification on arbitrary inputs. The core concepts—digit sequences versus specific prefixes and formats—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
