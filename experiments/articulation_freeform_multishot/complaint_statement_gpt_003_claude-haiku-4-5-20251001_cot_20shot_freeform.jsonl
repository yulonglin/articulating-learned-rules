The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text must mention dissatisfaction or criticize, focusing on explicit negative expressions. The Generated Rule categorizes any mention of negative sentiment—such as complaints, criticisms, problems, or dissatisfaction—as true, and positive or neutral sentiments as false. While the core concept of detecting negative sentiment about a product or experience is shared, the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit mention of dissatisfaction or criticism, whereas the Generated Rule broadly includes any negative sentiment, which may sometimes encompass less explicit expressions. Overall, they largely align in identifying negative experiences but differ slightly in the specificity and scope of what constitutes a negative statement.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
