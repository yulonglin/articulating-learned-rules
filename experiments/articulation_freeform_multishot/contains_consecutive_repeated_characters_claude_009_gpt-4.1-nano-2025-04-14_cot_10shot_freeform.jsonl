While \"ss\" is a particular example of a consecutive character sequence, the ground truth encompasses all such sequences, not just \"ss\". Therefore, the generated rule captures only a subset of the possible patterns that would make the ground truth rule classify an input as True. \n\nIn most cases where the only repeated characters are \"ss\", both rules agree. However, if the input contains other repeated sequences (e.g., \"oo\" or \"tt\") that are not \"ss\", the ground truth rule would classify them as True, but the generated rule would not. Conversely, if the only repeated sequence is \"ss\", both rules agree.\n\nThus, they are similar but not fully equivalent, with the generated rule being more specific. This results in a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
