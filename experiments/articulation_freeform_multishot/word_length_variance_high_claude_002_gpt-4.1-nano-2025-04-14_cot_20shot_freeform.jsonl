The False examples often contain only simple words or are just random sequences.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe pattern appears to be that sentences labeled True contain at least one complex or abstract word (e.g., words with many syllables or uncommon vocabulary), whereas False examples lack such words and are more random or simple.\n\nIn particular, the True examples include words like \"sophisticated,\" \"understanding,\" \"international,\" \"extraordinarily,\" \"comprehensive,\" \"incomprehensibility,\" \"unconventional,\" \"programming,\" \"implementation,\" \"communication,\" which are longer, more complex words.\n\nTherefore, the rule is:\n\n**A sentence is classified as True if it contains at least one complex or abstract word (e.g., words with multiple syllables or uncommon vocabulary); otherwise, it is False.**","keyword_match_score":0.23076923076923078,"rouge_l_score":0.27450980392156865,"llm_judge_score":0.2,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule focuses on the statistical variance in word lengths, specifically identifying texts with highly inconsistent word lengths. In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of complex or abstract words, which relates to vocabulary difficulty and syllabic complexity rather than length variability. These rules target different linguistic features—one measures distribution of word lengths, the other the complexity of individual words. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could have high variance in word lengths without containing complex words, or vice versa. The core concepts are not equivalent; thus, the two rules are largely different in their logic and focus.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
