The Generated rule, however, classifies sentences based on whether they describe human agency or personal traits versus scene, atmosphere, sensory experience, or events without human focus. While both rules aim to distinguish between human-centered content and non-human content, the Ground Truth emphasizes perspective and pronoun usage, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes the presence of human action or traits versus environmental or sensory descriptions. They share a common goal but differ in key features: one relies on perspective and pronouns, the other on content focus. Therefore, they are related but not perfectly aligned, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
