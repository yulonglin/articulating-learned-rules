The generated rule states that the output is True if any letter appears more than once anywhere in the word, regardless of position, and False if all letters are unique.\n\nWhile both rules involve repeated characters, the key difference is the pattern of repetition: the ground truth emphasizes consecutive repeats, whereas the generated rule considers any repeated letter, whether consecutive or not. As a result, they will agree on words with consecutive repeats (e.g., 'book' with 'oo') but may differ on words with non-consecutive repeats (e.g., 'bobo' contains repeated 'b' and 'o' but no consecutive repeats).\n\nTherefore, they are similar in capturing the concept of repeated characters but differ in the specific pattern they identify. This makes them closely related but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
