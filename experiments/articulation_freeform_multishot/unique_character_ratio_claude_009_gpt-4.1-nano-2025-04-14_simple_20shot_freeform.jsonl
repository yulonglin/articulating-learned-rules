In contrast, the generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains a sequence of at least three identical letters in a row, focusing specifically on repeated characters or sequences, regardless of overall character diversity. While both rules relate to character repetition, the ground truth considers the overall character diversity, whereas the generated rule targets specific repeated sequences. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., texts with many repeated characters), but they do not identify the same key features or patterns comprehensively. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in logic or outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
