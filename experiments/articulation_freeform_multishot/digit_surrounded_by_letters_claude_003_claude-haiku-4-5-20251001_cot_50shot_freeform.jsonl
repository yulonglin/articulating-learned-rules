The generated rule, however, classifies texts based on the presence of an alphanumeric code at the end or the absence of a specific template (\"The year [YEAR] was great\"). While both rules involve patterns of letters and digits, their core features differ: the ground truth emphasizes a particular positional pattern of digits within letters, whereas the generated rule centers on the presence of an alphanumeric token at the end and a specific template. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., a string like 'a5b' could be considered an alphanumeric code), but overall, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are not equivalent in their classification logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
