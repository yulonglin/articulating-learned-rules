The Ground Truth Rule explicitly mentions topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on specific subject areas. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"financial concepts, economic topics, or investment-related ideas,\" which are similar but slightly more general terms. Both rules exclude non-financial activities like leisure or personal interests. While the core concept—identifying financial/economic content—is aligned, the phrasing and scope differ slightly, leading to some potential differences in borderline cases. Overall, they are quite similar in intent and pattern but are not perfectly identical in wording or scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
