The generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of specific words from a fixed set, focusing on lexical content rather than word length distribution. These rules target different features—one is about word length variability, the other about specific words—so they are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their core concepts are quite different, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
