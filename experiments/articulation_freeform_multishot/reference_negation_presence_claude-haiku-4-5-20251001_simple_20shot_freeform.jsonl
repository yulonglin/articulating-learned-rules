The generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of contractions (words with apostrophes) or specific trigger words (e.g., \"fox,\" \"jumps,\" \"testing,\" etc.), which are unrelated to negation. These features do not overlap with negation words, and the patterns are fundamentally different. Therefore, they are not aligned in identifying the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs. The core concept of negation detection is absent from the generated rule, making their equivalence minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
