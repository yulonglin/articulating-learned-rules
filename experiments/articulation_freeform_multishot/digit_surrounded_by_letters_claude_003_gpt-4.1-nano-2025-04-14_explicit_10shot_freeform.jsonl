The generated rule, however, classifies based solely on the presence of a word containing any digit, without regard to the digit's position or surrounding characters. While both rules involve digits, the ground truth emphasizes a specific pattern involving letters around the digit, whereas the generated rule is more permissive and only requires a digit somewhere in a word. They would agree in some cases (e.g., 'a5b' contains a digit with letters around it and the word 'a5b' contains a digit), but they would differ in many others (e.g., 'abc5' would be classified as True by the generated rule but False by the ground truth, since '5' is not surrounded by letters). Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
