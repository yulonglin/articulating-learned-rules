They both focus on the presence of negative sentiment related to a product, service, or experience. The Ground Truth emphasizes the explicit statement of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule explicitly classifies based on whether the text describes a negative or positive experience, complaint, or praise. The core concept—distinguishing negative from positive feedback—is consistent. The main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, whereas the Generated Rule includes broader negative descriptors like \"problem\" or \"complaint,\" which generally align. Minor differences in phrasing or scope prevent a perfect score, but overall, they describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
