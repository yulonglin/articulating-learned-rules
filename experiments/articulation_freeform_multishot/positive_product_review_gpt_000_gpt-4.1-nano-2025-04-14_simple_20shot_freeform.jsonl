The Generated rule broadens this to include discussions of tangible benefits, convenience, or positive value, which may encompass neutral or informational mentions that are not necessarily sentiment-laden. Additionally, the Generated rule explicitly excludes general observations, aesthetic qualities, or neutral topics, which may or may not align with the positive sentiment focus of the Ground Truth. While there is some overlap—both rules target positive or beneficial mentions—their key features differ: one centers on sentiment about the product/service, the other on tangible benefits and positive value, potentially leading to different classifications in borderline cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
