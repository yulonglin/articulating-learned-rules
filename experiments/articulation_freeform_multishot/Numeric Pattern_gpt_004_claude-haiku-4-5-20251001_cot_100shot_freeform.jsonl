It focuses solely on the presence of a date pattern, regardless of how or where it appears.\n\nThe generated rule, however, specifies that the input must contain the phrase \"Meeting on\" followed by a date in specific formats (\"Month Day, Year\" or \"D/M/YYYY\"). It requires both the phrase and the date pattern, and only classifies as positive if both are present.\n\nWhile both rules involve date detection, they differ significantly in scope and conditions:\n- The ground truth is broader, detecting dates anywhere in the input.\n- The generated rule is narrower, requiring a specific phrase and specific date formats.\n\nThey do not identify the same key features or patterns, nor would they produce identical classifications on most inputs. The core concept of detecting dates is shared, but the context, phrasing, and specific formats differ, leading to only partial overlap in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
