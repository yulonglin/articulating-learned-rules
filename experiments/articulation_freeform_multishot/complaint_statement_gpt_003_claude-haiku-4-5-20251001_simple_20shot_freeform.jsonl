The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit mentions of negative opinions. The Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative experiences, complaints, or problems, which may encompass implicit or less direct expressions of dissatisfaction. While they largely overlap in identifying negative sentiments, the Generated Rule might classify some inputs as positive if they describe issues without explicitly criticizing, or vice versa. Overall, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, but slight differences in phrasing and scope prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
