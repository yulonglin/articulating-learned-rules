The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, while the Generated rule specifies that a text is classified as True if it discusses financial concepts, markets, economic indicators, or investment-related topics. The core concept—identifying financial or economic content—is consistent. However, the Generated rule introduces additional specific categories (markets, economic indicators) and explicitly states the classification logic, which may lead to slight differences in interpretation. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying financial topics, but the phrasing and scope differ somewhat, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
