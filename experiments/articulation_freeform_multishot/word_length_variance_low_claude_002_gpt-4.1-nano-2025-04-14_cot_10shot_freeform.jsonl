In contrast, the generated rule relies on the presence of common function words or repeated words to determine classification, focusing on lexical features and phrase structure rather than statistical properties of word lengths. While both rules aim to distinguish certain types of text, their key features differ: one emphasizes word length distribution, the other emphasizes specific word types and repetitions. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially since texts with similar length variance could lack function words, and texts with function words could have high variance in word lengths. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
