The Ground Truth rule states that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on the presence of criticism or dissatisfaction. The Generated Rule defines \"True\" as expressing a \"negative complaint, criticism, or dissatisfaction,\" and \"False\" as expressing positive sentiment or satisfaction. The core concept—identifying negative sentiment related to dissatisfaction—is consistent between them. \n\nHowever, the phrasing differs slightly: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule explicitly includes negative complaints and criticism as indicators of \"True.\" The Generated Rule also explicitly distinguishes positive sentiment as \"False,\" which is implied but not explicitly stated in the Ground Truth. \n\nOverall, they are very similar in intent and key features, with minor differences in phrasing and emphasis, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
