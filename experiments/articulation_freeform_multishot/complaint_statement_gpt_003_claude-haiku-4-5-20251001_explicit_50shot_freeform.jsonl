The Ground Truth emphasizes the explicit mention of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule explicitly classifies statements as True if they describe negative experiences or complaints, and False if they describe positive feedback. The core concept—distinguishing negative from positive feedback—is consistent. The main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, whereas the Generated Rule includes descriptions of problems or complaints as indicators of negativity. Overall, they align closely and would produce similar classifications in most cases, with only minor potential differences in phrasing or explicitness.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
