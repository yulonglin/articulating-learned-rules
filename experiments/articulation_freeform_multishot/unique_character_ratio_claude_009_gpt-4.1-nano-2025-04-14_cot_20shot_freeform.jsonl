In contrast, the generated rule focuses specifically on detecting repeated sequences of a single letter (case-insensitive) occurring at least three times consecutively or with minimal separation, emphasizing local pattern detection rather than overall character diversity. While both rules relate to character repetition, they target different aspects: the ground truth assesses overall diversity, whereas the generated rule looks for specific repeated patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs, and their core concepts—global diversity versus local repetition—are not fully aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
