The generated rule considers inputs as TRUE if they are repetitive (characters, words, sequences) or very short exclamations, and FALSE for longer, varied proverbs or phrases. While both rules focus on predictability and repetition, the ground truth emphasizes a quantitative measure (entropy), whereas the generated rule relies on heuristic features like length and perceived repetitiveness. They overlap in identifying repetitive or predictable patterns but differ in scope and specificity. The generated rule may misclassify some texts with low entropy but no obvious repetition, or vice versa. Overall, they share a core concept but are not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
