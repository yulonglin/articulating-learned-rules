The Ground Truth emphasizes the use of first-person pronouns and introspective language, directly indicating personal engagement. The Generated rule also centers on identifying personal experience, feelings, or reflections, primarily through first-person perspective and emotional or introspective language. While the phrasing differs—one explicitly mentions pronouns and the other emphasizes personal engagement—the core concept of distinguishing personal, subjective content from external observations is aligned. The main difference is that the Generated rule is slightly more general in describing \"personal experience, feeling, thought, or reflection,\" whereas the Ground Truth explicitly highlights first-person perspective. Overall, they largely capture the same classification logic, but the Ground Truth's focus on pronouns provides a more concrete pattern, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
