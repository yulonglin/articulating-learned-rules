The generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of gibberish words, which is a completely different feature—semantic or lexical recognition rather than structural length patterns. They do not identify the same key features; one is about word length sequences, the other about word recognizability. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on the same inputs, especially since a text could have Fibonacci-length words but no gibberish, or contain gibberish words but not follow the Fibonacci length pattern. The core concepts are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
