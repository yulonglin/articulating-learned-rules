In contrast, the Generated Rule centers on specific lexical cues (\"heard\" vs. \"said\") and the capitalization and content of quoted words (e.g., \"Stop\"). While both rules involve quoted text, their key features differ: the Ground Truth emphasizes nesting depth, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes particular words and their context. They may overlap in some cases where nested quotes contain \"heard\" and a specific quoted word, but generally, they target different patterns. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and are not equivalent in core concept or likely to produce identical classifications.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
