The generated rule classifies texts as positive if they contain at least one exclamation mark (!) or ellipsis (...), which is a much broader criterion. While both rules identify some forms of punctuation-based emphasis, they do not align closely: the ground truth requires a specific pattern (three or more identical punctuation), whereas the generated rule only checks for the presence of certain punctuation marks, regardless of sequence length or repetition. Consequently, they would produce different classifications on many inputs, especially those with single punctuation marks or different patterns. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
