The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include highlighting negative experiences or issues, which may encompass implicit or more general negative mentions. They largely overlap in identifying negative sentiments about a product or service. However, the Generated Rule explicitly states that positive, neutral, or unrelated statements should be classified as False, which aligns with the Ground Truth's focus on explicit dissatisfaction. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"issues\" and \"problems,\" potentially capturing a slightly broader set of negative statements. Overall, they share the core concept of detecting dissatisfaction or criticism, making them closely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
