The generated rule classifies texts as true based on a statistical property of the text—specifically, whether the number of unique words exceeds half of the total words. These criteria are fundamentally different: one is linguistic (negation words), the other is structural (word repetition/uniqueness). They rarely align; for example, a text with negation words but no repeated words would be classified as negative by the ground truth but not necessarily as true by the generated rule. Conversely, texts with many unique words but no negation would be classified as true by the generated rule but not as negative by the ground truth. Therefore, their logical focus and resulting classifications are largely incompatible, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.4897959183673469,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":24,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.4897959183673469},"parse_error":false}
