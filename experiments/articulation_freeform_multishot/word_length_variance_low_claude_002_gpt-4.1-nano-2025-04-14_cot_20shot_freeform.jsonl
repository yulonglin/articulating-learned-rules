In contrast, the generated rule relies on the presence of repeated or simple words versus complex, abstract words, emphasizing lexical repetition and word complexity rather than length distribution. These criteria target different linguistic features and are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently. While both rules relate to word characteristics, their core concepts—length variance versus lexical simplicity and repetition—are not equivalent, leading to minimal overlap in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
