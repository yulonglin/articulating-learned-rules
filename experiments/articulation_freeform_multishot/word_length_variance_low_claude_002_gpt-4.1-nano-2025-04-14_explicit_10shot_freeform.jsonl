It does not consider the actual words, their types, or their relationships.\n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on the presence of specific patterns involving known words—particularly, adjacent pairs of articles or nouns—and the overall validity of words from a predefined set. It emphasizes syntactic patterns and vocabulary constraints rather than statistical properties of word lengths.\n\nWhile both rules involve analyzing words within the text, their core features differ significantly: one focuses on statistical distribution of word lengths, the other on specific word patterns and vocabulary validity. They are not equivalent in identifying the same key features or patterns, nor would they generally produce the same classifications across most inputs.\n\nTherefore, the core concepts are not aligned, and the rules do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
