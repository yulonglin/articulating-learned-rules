This can include texts with many repeated characters, but also texts with predictable patterns or limited character variety, not necessarily just a single repeated character.\n\nThe generated rule, however, specifically identifies only texts composed entirely of a single repeated character as TRUE, and all others as FALSE. This is a much stricter criterion and captures only a subset of the low-entropy texts—namely, those with perfect repetition.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify predictable or repetitive texts, the ground truth rule is broader, encompassing any text with low entropy, which can include patterned but non-uniform texts. The generated rule is narrower, focusing solely on uniform repetition.\n\nTherefore, they do not identify exactly the same set of texts, and their core concepts differ: one measures overall entropy (broader), the other checks for uniform repetition (more restrictive). They are related but not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
