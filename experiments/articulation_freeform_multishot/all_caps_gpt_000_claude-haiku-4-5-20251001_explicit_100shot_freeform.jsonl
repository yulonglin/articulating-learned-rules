It does not specify any particular words or require multiple words; it simply checks for uppercase letters throughout.\n\nThe Generated Rule, on the other hand, requires the text to be in ALL CAPS (or contain only ALL CAPS words, numbers, and spaces) and additionally mandates that at least two words from a specific set are present. This introduces a word-based condition that is not present in the ground truth. Moreover, the generated rule's \"ALL CAPS\" condition is more complex, allowing for numbers and spaces, and the requirement of at least two specific words is a significant additional constraint.\n\nWhile both rules rely on uppercase text, the generated rule's emphasis on specific words and the count of such words diverges from the ground truth's more general uppercase-only criterion. They may produce similar results in some cases (e.g., all uppercase text with multiple words from the set), but they are not equivalent in core logic.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their agreement on inputs is limited.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
