The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of at least one word with alternating uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., 'aBcDeF'), which is a specific pattern of mixed case. The Generated Rule states that any word with both uppercase and lowercase letters (mixed case) suffices, regardless of the pattern within the word. \n\nThe key difference is that the Ground Truth specifies a particular pattern (alternating case), while the Generated Rule considers any mixed case as sufficient. However, in most practical scenarios, words with alternating case are a subset of words with mixed case, so the rules largely align in their classification. They would produce the same results in most cases, especially when the focus is on detecting words with both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nThe core concept—presence of at least one word with both uppercase and lowercase letters—is consistent between the two. The main difference is the specificity of the pattern (alternating vs. any mixed case), which accounts for a slight divergence, but overall, they are functionally very similar.\n\nTherefore, a score of 9 reflects that they are nearly equivalent in intent and practical outcome, with a minor difference in pattern specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
