This implies that all words in the text are of similar length, indicating uniformity in word size. In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the perceived simplicity or complexity of vocabulary, primarily considering word familiarity, commonality, and syllable count. While shorter, simpler words tend to have similar lengths, the generated rule does not explicitly measure word length variance; it relies on qualitative assessments of word complexity. Therefore, they partially overlap in that simple, short words often have low variance in length, but the generated rule is broader and more subjective, potentially including texts with similar-length but complex words or excluding simple texts with more variable word lengths. They do not identify the same key features or patterns directly, and their classifications may diverge on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
