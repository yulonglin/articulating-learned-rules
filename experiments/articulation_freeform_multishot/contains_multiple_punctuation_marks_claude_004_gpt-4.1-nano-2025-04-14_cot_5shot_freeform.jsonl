The generated rule, however, classifies inputs as True if they contain at least one valid Python identifier (word) after removing non-alphanumeric characters, which is a different pattern entirely. The key features differ: one focuses on punctuation frequency, the other on the presence of valid identifiers. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, as they target different textual features.
