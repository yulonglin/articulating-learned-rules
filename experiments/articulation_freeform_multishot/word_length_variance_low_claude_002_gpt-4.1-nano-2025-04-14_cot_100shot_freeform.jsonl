The examples labeled True often contain the words \"mat,\" \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"and,\" \"the,\" or \"run,\" and these words appear multiple times or in certain combinations.\n2. Many True examples include at least one of the words \"mat,\" \"cat,\" or \"dog\" and often contain the word \"and\" or \"the.\"\n3. False examples tend to contain complex, long words like \"antidisestablishmentarianism,\" \"unconventional,\" \"extraordinarily,\" \"comprehensive,\" \"understanding,\" \"programming,\" \"incomprehensibility,\" or repeated words that are not simple nouns or common words.\n4. The presence of long, complex words correlates with False, while simpler, common words like \"mat,\" \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"and,\" \"the,\" \"run\" correlate with True.\n5. Many True examples are simple sentences or phrases with these common words, while False examples often involve complex, uncommon words or combinations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pattern is that the classification is based on the presence of simple, common words (\"mat,\" \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"and,\" \"the,\" \"run\") and the absence of complex, long, or uncommon words. If the input contains only simple, common words and no complex words, it is classified as True; otherwise, it is False.","keyword_match_score":0.23076923076923078,"rouge_l_score":0.13333333333333333,"llm_judge_score":0.4,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule classifies texts based on the statistical property of word length variance, specifically that the variance is less than 2. This emphasizes a quantitative measure of word length consistency across the entire text. In contrast, the generated rule relies on the presence or absence of specific simple, common words and the absence of complex or long words, focusing on lexical content rather than statistical properties. While both rules aim to identify \"simple\" or \"consistent\" texts, they do so through different features: one via numerical variance of word lengths, the other via lexical content. They may produce similar classifications in some cases (e.g., very simple, uniform texts), but they are not equivalent in core concept or methodology.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
