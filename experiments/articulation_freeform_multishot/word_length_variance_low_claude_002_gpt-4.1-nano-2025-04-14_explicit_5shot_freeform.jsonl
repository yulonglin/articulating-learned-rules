In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of repeated words, which relates to lexical repetition rather than word length patterns. These criteria are fundamentally different: one focuses on statistical properties of word lengths, the other on word frequency. They do not identify the same features or patterns, and they are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs. The core concepts—word length consistency versus word repetition—are not equivalent, making the rules largely unrelated in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
