The generated rule, however, classifies texts as positive only if they contain specific trigger words and end with punctuation (!, ?, or .). These are fundamentally different criteria: the ground truth focuses on punctuation patterns, while the generated rule emphasizes specific words and ending punctuation. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concept of detecting repeated punctuation is not equivalent to the presence of certain words plus ending punctuation.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6326530612244898,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.6326530612244898},"parse_error":false}
