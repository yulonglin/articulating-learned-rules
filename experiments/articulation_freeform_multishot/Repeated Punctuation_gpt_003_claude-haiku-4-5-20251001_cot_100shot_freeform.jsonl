The generated rule, however, classifies texts as positive if they end with repeated punctuation marks (2 or more), including emphasis through multiple punctuation marks, and considers whether the text contains emphasis via multiple punctuation marks. It also explicitly includes emphasis through multiple punctuation marks, which may encompass sequences of two or more, not necessarily three.\n\nWhile both rules recognize repeated punctuation as a marker of emphasis or positivity, the ground truth emphasizes sequences of three or more, whereas the generated rule considers sequences of two or more, and also emphasizes the position (end of text). Therefore, they do not perfectly align in pattern detection or criteria.\n\nThey share the core concept of repeated punctuation indicating positivity/emphasis, but differ in the specific threshold (≥3 vs. ≥2) and positional considerations. As a result, they would produce similar classifications in many cases but diverge in some, especially with texts containing only double punctuation or lacking sequences of three or more.\n\nOverall, the core idea is similar but not equivalent, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
