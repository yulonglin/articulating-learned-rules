The generated rule, however, relies on the presence of specific common words or a particular pattern at the start of the input, focusing on explicit word inclusion and a specific phrase pattern. These rules are based on fundamentally different features: one on statistical distribution of word lengths, the other on specific word presence and positional patterns. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications across most inputs, especially since many texts with low variance in word length may not contain the specified words, and texts with the specified words may have high variance in word length. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their classification logic differs significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
