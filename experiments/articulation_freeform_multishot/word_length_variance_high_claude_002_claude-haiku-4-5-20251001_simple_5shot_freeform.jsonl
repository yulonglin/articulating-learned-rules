The generated rule classifies text as TRUE based on the presence of at least two words sharing a common prefix of at least 2 letters, focusing on word similarity or prefix matching. These are fundamentally different features: one examines length variability, the other examines prefix similarity. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts—length variance versus prefix sharing—are not equivalent. Therefore, the two rules do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.52,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.52},"parse_error":false}
