In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE if they contain at least one sequence of three or more consecutive punctuation marks, emphasizing the presence of specific punctuation patterns rather than overall proportion. While both rules relate to punctuation, they target different features: the ground truth considers total punctuation density, whereas the generated rule looks for particular punctuation sequences. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., heavily punctuated texts with long sequences), but generally, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs, and their core concepts differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
