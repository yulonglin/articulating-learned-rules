The generated rule, however, restricts classification solely to anagrams of \"listen.\" While both rules involve anagram detection, the ground truth encompasses a broader set of words (three specific examples), whereas the generated rule focuses only on one. They share the core concept of identifying anagrams, but the scope differs significantly, leading to different classifications for words that are anagrams of \"below\" or \"study\" but not \"listen.\" Therefore, they are similar in concept but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
