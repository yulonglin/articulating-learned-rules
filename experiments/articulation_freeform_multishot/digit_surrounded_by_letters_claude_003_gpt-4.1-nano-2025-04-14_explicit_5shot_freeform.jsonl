The generated rule, however, states that the text is classified as True if it contains at least one word with a lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit (e.g., \"w1t\", \"i0a\"). This emphasizes a different pattern: a letter directly preceding a digit within a word, without requiring the digit to be flanked by letters on both sides.\n\nWhile both rules involve digits and letters, the key features differ:  \n- The ground truth looks for a digit sandwiched between letters anywhere in the text.  \n- The generated rule looks for a lowercase letter directly followed by a digit within a word, which is a narrower pattern.\n\nThey may overlap in some cases (e.g., \"a5b\" contains 'a' before '5' and 'b' after '5', satisfying the ground truth; \"w1t\" contains 'w' before '1', satisfying the generated rule), but they are not equivalent in scope. The generated rule does not require the digit to be flanked by letters on both sides, nor does it specify the position within the text, so they would produce different classifications in many cases.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are related but not equivalent, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
