The generated rule classifies an input as True only if it contains the letter \"s\" anywhere in the word, ignoring repeated characters altogether. These rules are fundamentally different: one detects repeated characters, the other detects presence of a specific letter. They would rarely produce the same classification, especially for inputs without \"s\" or without repeated characters.
