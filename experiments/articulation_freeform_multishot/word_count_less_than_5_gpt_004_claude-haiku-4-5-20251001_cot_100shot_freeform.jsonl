The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain exactly one word or a specific compatible pair of two words, and False otherwise, which is a much narrower and more specific pattern. These rules do not align in key features or patterns; the ground truth emphasizes overall length, while the generated rule emphasizes specific word combinations. They would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs, especially since the generated rule excludes inputs with 2, 3, or 4 words unless they match particular pairs, whereas the ground truth includes all inputs with fewer than 5 words regardless of content. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9183673469387755,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.9183673469387755},"parse_error":false}
