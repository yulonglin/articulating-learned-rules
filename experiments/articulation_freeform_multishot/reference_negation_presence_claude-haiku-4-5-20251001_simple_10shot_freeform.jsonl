The generated rule classifies text as True if it contains at least one unique (non-duplicate) word, and False if all words are repeated, which is unrelated to negation detection. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; they are based on entirely different criteria. While both rules produce binary outputs, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they would rarely produce the same classification on the same input. Therefore, their logical basis and the features they detect are fundamentally different.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
