The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct mentions of dissatisfaction or critique. The Generated Rule broadly classifies any mention of a complaint, problem, or negative aspect as True, and positive or neutral aspects as False. They share the core concept of detecting negative sentiment or criticism, but the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, while the Generated Rule includes a wider range of negative indicators (complaints, problems, negative aspects) that may sometimes be more implicit. Overall, they largely align in identifying negative or critical content, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
