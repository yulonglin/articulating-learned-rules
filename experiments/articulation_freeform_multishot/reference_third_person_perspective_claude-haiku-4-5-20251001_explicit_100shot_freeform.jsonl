The Ground Truth emphasizes third-person perspective and internal states, while the Generated rule categorizes based on whether the narrative centers on a person’s actions or feelings versus environmental descriptions. They largely align in identifying person-focused versus scene-focused content, but the Ground Truth explicitly mentions perspective and pronoun usage, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes the focus of the narrative. This difference in phrasing accounts for a slight divergence, preventing a perfect score. Overall, they share the core concept of differentiating person-centric from scene-centric descriptions.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
