The Ground Truth specifies nesting at least two levels deep, exemplified by quotes within quotes, such as 'He said \"She told me \\\"No\\\"\"'. The Generated Rule states that the classification is true if the text contains nested quotation marks (a quote within a quote, indicated by escaped quotes like `\\\"`), and false if only single-level quotes are present.\n\nThe key difference is in the explicit mention of nesting depth: the Ground Truth emphasizes at least two levels of nesting, whereas the Generated Rule broadly states \"nested quotation marks\" without explicitly specifying the depth. However, in practice, detecting nested quotes (especially with escaped characters) aligns closely with identifying at least two levels of nesting.\n\nMost inputs with quotes nested at least two levels will be classified as true by both rules. Conversely, texts with only one level of quotes will be classified as false by both. The main divergence could occur in ambiguous cases (e.g., unescaped quotes or unusual nesting), but overall, the core concept—detecting nested quotations—is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the two rules are largely aligned in their intent and practical application, warranting a high equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
