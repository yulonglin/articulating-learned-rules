The generated rule, however, requires that at least one word contains an exclamation mark and that the total number of exclamation marks in the input is odd; otherwise, it labels the input as False. These criteria differ significantly: the ground truth emphasizes total count (≥2), while the generated rule combines a per-word condition with an odd total count, which can lead to different classifications. For example, an input with exactly two exclamation marks (both attached to different words) would be True under the ground truth but might be False under the generated rule if the total count is even. Conversely, inputs with a single exclamation mark attached to a word would be False under the generated rule but could be True if the total count is odd and the word contains an exclamation mark. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications will often differ.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
