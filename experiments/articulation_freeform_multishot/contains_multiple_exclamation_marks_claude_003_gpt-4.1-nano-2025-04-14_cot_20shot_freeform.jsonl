In contrast, the generated rule considers only the presence of at least one exclamation mark *inside* a word (not at the start or end), and classifies as True if such an internal exclamation mark exists. This means:  \n- The ground truth can be satisfied by multiple exclamation marks scattered throughout the input, even if none are inside words.  \n- The generated rule requires at least one internal exclamation mark within a word, which is a more specific pattern.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. The generated rule is more restrictive and focuses on internal exclamation marks within words, while the ground truth is based solely on the count of exclamation marks regardless of position. They would produce similar classifications only in cases where multiple exclamation marks are inside words, but often they would differ.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
