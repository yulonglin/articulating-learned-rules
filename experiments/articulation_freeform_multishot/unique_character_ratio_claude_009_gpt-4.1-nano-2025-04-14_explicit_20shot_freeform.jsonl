This broadly captures texts with repetitive or highly uniform content, regardless of specific token structure.\n\nThe generated rule, however, specifies that a text is TRUE only if it consists solely of a single repeated token (word or letter) repeated at least three times, with optional spaces or punctuation, and no other tokens present. This is a much more restrictive pattern, focusing on exact repetition of a single token, rather than overall character variety.\n\nWhile both rules tend to identify highly repetitive texts, the ground truth rule can classify texts with limited character variety that are not necessarily composed of a single repeated token (e.g., texts with a few characters repeated in a pattern), whereas the generated rule only classifies texts that are strictly composed of one repeated token.\n\nTherefore, they share a core concept of repetition but differ significantly in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
