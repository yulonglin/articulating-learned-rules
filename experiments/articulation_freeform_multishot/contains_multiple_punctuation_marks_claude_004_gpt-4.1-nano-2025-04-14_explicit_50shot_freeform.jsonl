In contrast, the generated rule classifies a text as True if it contains at least one alphabetic word that includes at least one punctuation character within the word boundaries, regardless of the total number of punctuation marks. These are fundamentally different patterns: the ground truth emphasizes the total punctuation count, while the generated rule emphasizes the presence of a punctuated word containing alphabetic characters. They do not identify the same key features and would likely produce different classifications on many inputs. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
