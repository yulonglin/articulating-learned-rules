The ground truth emphasizes the pattern of any character appearing two or more times in a row, which directly corresponds to the presence of a consecutive pair. The generated rule explicitly states that the word must contain at least one such pair of consecutive identical letters. Their core concepts—detecting consecutive identical characters—are identical, and they would produce the same classifications across all inputs.
