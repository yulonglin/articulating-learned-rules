The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of \"at least one word with a hyphen connecting two parts,\" which is a direct description of hyphenated words. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the text is classified as True if it contains \"at least one hyphenated word\" and provides examples, reinforcing the same pattern. The core concept—detecting hyphenated words—is consistent between both rules. The slight difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions examples and the phrasing \"words with hyphens like,\" but this does not alter the fundamental logic. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same key feature and would produce the same classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
