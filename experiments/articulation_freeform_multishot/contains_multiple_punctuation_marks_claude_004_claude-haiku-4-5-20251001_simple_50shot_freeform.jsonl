The generated rule, however, considers whether at least one word has embedded or attached punctuation and also imposes conditions on the number of distinct words (fewer than 5) or the presence of repeated words, aiming to identify \"punctuated\" words within a short or repetitive text.  \n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their core features differ:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes the total count of punctuation marks.  \n- The generated rule emphasizes embedded punctuation within words and the overall word count or repetition, not directly counting punctuation marks.  \n\nThey may overlap in some cases (e.g., short texts with punctuated words), but generally, they target different patterns. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and are unlikely to produce identical outputs across most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
