The Generated Rule, however, focuses on whether the sentence describes human agency, personal qualities, or actions, regardless of perspective or pronoun usage. While both rules aim to identify sentences that highlight human characteristics or actions, the Ground Truth rule explicitly requires third-person perspective, whereas the Generated rule does not specify perspective and is more about content focus. As a result, they overlap in identifying sentences about human agency but differ in their scope and criteria, leading to partial but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
