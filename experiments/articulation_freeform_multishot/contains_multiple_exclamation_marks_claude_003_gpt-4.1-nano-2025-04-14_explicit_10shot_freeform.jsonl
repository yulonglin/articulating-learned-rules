The generated rule, however, requires that every word in the string be immediately preceded or followed by an exclamation mark, which is a much stricter and different condition. While both rules involve exclamation marks, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. The generated rule's condition is more specific and would rarely match the ground truth's criterion unless the text is very particular. Therefore, they would not produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
