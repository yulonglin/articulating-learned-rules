The generated rule classifies an input as True if any letter appears more than once anywhere in the word, regardless of position, focusing on *non-consecutive repeated characters*. While both rules involve repeated characters, their key features differ: the ground truth emphasizes *consecutive repeats*, whereas the generated rule emphasizes *any repeated character*, including non-consecutive ones. As a result, they will produce the same classification only in cases where repeated characters are adjacent, but will differ when repeated characters are separated by other characters. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in logic, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
