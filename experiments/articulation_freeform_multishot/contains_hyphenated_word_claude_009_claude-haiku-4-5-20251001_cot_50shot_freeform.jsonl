The Ground Truth mentions \"a hyphen connecting two parts\" (e.g., \"well-known\"), which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on hyphenated words, including examples like \"up-to-date\" and \"state-of-the-art.\" The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly lists several common hyphenated words, but this does not change the core concept. They both identify the presence of hyphenated words as the key feature for classification. The slight difference in phrasing and examples accounts for the minor deduction from a perfect score. Overall, the core logic and pattern detection are effectively the same.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
