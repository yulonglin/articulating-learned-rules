The generated rule classifies an input as True if it contains at least one exclamation mark, which is a broader condition. Therefore, the key feature (presence of exclamation marks) is shared, but the thresholds differ significantly. The generated rule would classify many inputs with only one exclamation mark as True, whereas the ground truth would classify them as False. While both rules focus on exclamation marks, their core concepts differ in the number of marks needed for classification, leading to different outputs in many cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
