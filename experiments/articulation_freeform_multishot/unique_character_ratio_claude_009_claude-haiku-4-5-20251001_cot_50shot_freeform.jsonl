The generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains a repeated unit (word, letter, or symbol) at least 3 times, regardless of overall character diversity. While both rules focus on repetition, the ground truth emphasizes character variety and overall repetition ratio, whereas the generated rule centers on the presence of a specific repeated unit. They may overlap in some cases—texts with high repetition of a single character or word could be classified similarly—but they are not equivalent in core concept. The generated rule is more specific about repeated units, while the ground truth considers overall character diversity. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and are only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
