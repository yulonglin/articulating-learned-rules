The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain 1-2 words and none are in the forbidden set, otherwise False. This means:  \n- The ground truth considers any input with 1-4 words as True, regardless of whether they include forbidden words or not.  \n- The generated rule restricts True to only 1-2 words and excludes any with forbidden words, and classifies 3-4 words as False.  \n\nTherefore, they differ significantly in key features:  \n- The ground truth allows longer inputs (up to 4 words) to be True, while the generated rule does not.  \n- The generated rule introduces the forbidden set constraint, which is not present in the ground truth.  \n\nWhile both rules agree on very short inputs (1-2 words without forbidden words), they diverge on inputs with 3-4 words, and the forbidden set is an additional, unrelated constraint. Overall, they do not describe the same logic, and their classifications will differ on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
