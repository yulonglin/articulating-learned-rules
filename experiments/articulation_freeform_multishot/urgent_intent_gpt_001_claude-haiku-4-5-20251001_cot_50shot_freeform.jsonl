The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the immediacy and urgency. The Generated Rule broadens this to include emergencies, crises, or safety threats requiring immediate response, and explicitly distinguishes non-urgent, routine, or pleasantry communications. While the phrasing differs, the core concept of detecting messages that demand prompt action due to an urgent situation is aligned. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes safety threats and emphasizes the context of preventing harm or loss of life, which slightly broadens the scope. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying urgent, action-requiring messages, making them quite similar in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
