This implies a broad pattern: words that are anagrams of these specific words, which are different in length and letter composition. The generated rule, however, specifies that a word must be an anagram of \"silent\" only, which is a single, specific word.  \n\nKey differences:  \n- The ground truth encompasses multiple words (\"listen,\" \"below,\" \"study\") with different letter sets and lengths, thus covering a wider set of anagrams.  \n- The generated rule restricts classification to anagrams of \"silent\" only, ignoring other potential anagrams of \"listen\" (which is explicitly included in the ground truth) and unrelated words like \"below\" or \"study.\"  \n\nOn most inputs, the generated rule will classify \"listen\" and \"tinsel\" as True, aligning with the ground truth for \"listen\" and its anagrams, but it will exclude words like \"below\" or \"study\" that are part of the ground truth pattern. Conversely, it will incorrectly classify words that are anagrams of \"silent\" but not related to the broader set of words in the ground truth.  \n\nTherefore, while there is some overlap (both involve anagrams), the core concepts differ significantly, making the rules not fully equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
