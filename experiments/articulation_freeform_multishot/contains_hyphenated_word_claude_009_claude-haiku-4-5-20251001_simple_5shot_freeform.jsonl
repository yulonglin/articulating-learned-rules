The Generated Rule also considers hyphenated words as a key feature but introduces an additional pattern: the presence of the word \"over\" paired with specific words like \"python\" or \"mat\" to determine True, and explicitly states False if neither condition is met. This means the Generated Rule potentially classifies inputs differently when they contain hyphenated words but lack the \"over\" + specific word pattern, or vice versa. While both rules recognize hyphenated words as important, the Generated Rule incorporates an extra pattern that the Ground Truth does not. Therefore, they are not equivalent in their logic, though they share some common ground regarding hyphenated words.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
