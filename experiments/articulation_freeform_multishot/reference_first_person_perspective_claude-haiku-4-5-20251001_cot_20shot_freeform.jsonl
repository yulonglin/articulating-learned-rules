The Generated rule centers on the content of the cases—internal emotional states and personal reflections versus objective external descriptions—without explicitly mentioning perspective or language style. While both rules aim to distinguish subjective, internal content from objective external facts, they do so through different key features: the Ground Truth emphasizes linguistic perspective, whereas the Generated emphasizes content type. As a result, they may overlap in many cases but are not perfectly aligned; they could classify differently in scenarios where subjective content is expressed without first-person pronouns or where external descriptions include internal states.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
