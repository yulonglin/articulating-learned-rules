The Ground Truth emphasizes perspective and first-person perspective explicitly, while the Generated Rule broadens the scope to include \"we\" and \"us,\" and explicitly mentions agency, emotion, discovery, or internal states. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule also explicitly states that \"False\" includes external observations, factual statements, or events without personal involvement, aligning with the Ground Truth's focus on external/objective descriptions. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions \"particularly those involving agency, emotion, discovery, or internal states,\" which adds some nuance not explicitly present in the Ground Truth.\n\nOverall, they largely overlap in identifying internal/personal content versus external/objective content, but the phrasing and emphasis differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
