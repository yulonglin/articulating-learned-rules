The Ground Truth emphasizes the first-person perspective (I, me, my, we, us), which directly targets personal viewpoint and emotional content. The Generated Rule broadly classifies statements as \"True\" if they express personal feelings, struggles, or ongoing personal situations/goals, and \"False\" otherwise, focusing on emotional and personal content rather than perspective per se. \n\nWhile there is significant overlap—both rules identify subjective, personal, or emotional statements as \"True\"—the Ground Truth's focus on first-person pronouns is more explicit about perspective, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes emotional and personal content without explicitly referencing perspective. This means they generally align but may diverge in cases where a statement is subjective but not first-person, or vice versa.\n\nOverall, they share core concepts but differ slightly in their key features and patterns, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
