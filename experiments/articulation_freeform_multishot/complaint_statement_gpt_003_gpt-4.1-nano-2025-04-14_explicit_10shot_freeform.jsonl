The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadly describes labeling texts as True if they contain negative aspects like issues or complaints. They share the core concept of detecting negative or problematic mentions. However, the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, whereas the Generated Rule allows for a more general identification of negative or problematic aspects, which could include subtle or implied issues. This slight difference means they would generally produce similar classifications but might diverge in edge cases where negativity is implied rather than explicitly stated.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
