The Ground Truth specifies topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on specific subject areas. The Generated rule broadens this to include finance, economics, or investment topics, and explicitly states that non-financial subjects (leisure, personal interests) should be classified as False. While the phrasing differs, the core concept—identifying financial or economic content—is similar. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly includes economics and clarifies the negative class as non-financial subjects, which may slightly expand or clarify the scope. Overall, they largely align in identifying financial content, making their classification logic very similar, but not perfectly identical due to slight differences in scope and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
