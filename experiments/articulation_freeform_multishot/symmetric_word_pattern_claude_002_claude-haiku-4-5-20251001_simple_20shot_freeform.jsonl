The ground truth emphasizes the presence of \"at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which is the core feature. The generated rule explicitly states the output is True if such a palindromic word exists and provides examples, aligning closely with the ground truth. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly states the output and includes example words, but the underlying pattern—identifying at least one palindromic word—is the same. The slight difference in phrasing and presentation accounts for a near-perfect match, but the core logic remains equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
