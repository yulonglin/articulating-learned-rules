The ground truth emphasizes that every alphabetic character must be uppercase, while the generated rule specifies that all words are in uppercase (ALL CAPS), which is essentially the same condition, assuming words are defined as sequences of alphabetic characters. Both rules exclude inputs with any lowercase letters. The main difference is in phrasing: the ground truth focuses on individual characters, whereas the generated rule emphasizes words being in uppercase. This difference is minor, and in most cases, they will produce the same classification. However, the generated rule's reliance on \"words\" could potentially lead to edge cases if non-word tokens are present, but generally, they are functionally equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
