The generated rule, however, classifies inputs as True only if there is at least one word with an embedded exclamation mark, which is a very different pattern—it's more restrictive and specific. They do not identify the same key features: the ground truth focuses on the count of exclamation marks, while the generated rule focuses on the presence of embedded exclamation marks within words. Consequently, they would produce different classifications on most inputs, especially those with multiple standalone exclamation marks but no embedded ones, or vice versa. The core concepts are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
