The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any explicit expression or description of an emotional state or feeling, whether positive or negative, and explicitly excludes descriptions of physical scenes, sensory details, actions, or events without emotional content. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting emotional expression—is aligned, the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"explicitly expresses or describes\" and the explicit exclusion of non-emotional descriptions makes it slightly more comprehensive and precise. They would generally produce similar classifications, but the Generated Rule's broader wording might classify some borderline cases differently. Overall, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, hence a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
