It focuses on counting the number of punctuation marks from a defined set, regardless of their placement within words or in relation to words.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if there is at least one punctuation mark embedded within or adjacent to words, emphasizing the presence of punctuation within words rather than counting the total number. It also considers any non-alphanumeric character (except spaces) that breaks or decorates words as a trigger, which is a broader criterion than the ground truth.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their core concepts differ:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes the *quantity* (three or more) of specific punctuation marks.  \n- The generated rule emphasizes *presence* of punctuation within words, regardless of count, and includes a broader set of punctuation characters.\n\nThey would produce similar classifications in cases where the input contains multiple punctuation marks from the specified set, especially if there are at least three. However, the generated rule might classify inputs as True with only one punctuation mark if it is embedded within a word, whereas the ground truth requires at least three such marks.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent in logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
