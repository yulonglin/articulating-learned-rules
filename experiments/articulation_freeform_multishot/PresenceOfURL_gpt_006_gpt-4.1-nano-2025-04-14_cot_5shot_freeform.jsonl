The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', while the Generated rule broadens this to URLs starting with 'http' or 'https' and emphasizes the presence or absence of URLs for classification. They share the core concept of detecting URLs to determine classification. However, the Generated rule explicitly includes 'https' and clarifies that the presence of any URL leads to a true classification, which aligns closely with the Ground Truth but slightly expands the pattern scope. Overall, they are very similar in intent and key features, with minor differences in phrasing and URL pattern specifics.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
