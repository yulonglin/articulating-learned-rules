This is a numeric pattern-based criterion focused on the proportion of digits relative to letters.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies text as TRUE if it contains specific types of identifiers like flight or ticket numbers, which are characterized by alphanumeric identifiers. It then classifies as FALSE when the text describes general events, times, or durations without such identifiers.\n\nWhile both rules involve numeric content, their core concepts differ:  \n- The ground truth rule relies on a measurable ratio of digits to letters, regardless of context or specific content types.  \n- The generated rule depends on the presence of particular identifier patterns, not on the overall numeric-to-letter ratio.\n\nThey may overlap in some cases—texts with identifiers often have high digit-to-letter ratios—but they are not equivalent in their logic or scope. The generated rule does not account for the overall ratio of digits to letters, nor does it consider the broader content, making their classification criteria fundamentally different.\n\nTherefore, they are only loosely related and do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
