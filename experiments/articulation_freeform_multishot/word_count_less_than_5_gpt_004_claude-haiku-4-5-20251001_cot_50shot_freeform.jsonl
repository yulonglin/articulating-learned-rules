The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain exactly one word or exactly two distinct words with no repetitions, and False otherwise. These rules differ significantly: the ground truth allows for inputs with 1, 2, 3, or 4 words, while the generated rule only accepts 1 or 2 distinct words with no repetitions. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and would produce different classifications on many inputs—particularly those with 3 or 4 words. The core concepts are not equivalent, as the generated rule imposes stricter conditions focused on word count and repetition, whereas the ground truth is based solely on total word count.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
