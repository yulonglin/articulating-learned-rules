In contrast, the generated rule requires the presence of at least one question mark and one semicolon, with no regard to the total number of punctuation marks or other punctuation types. These rules differ significantly in their key features: the ground truth emphasizes quantity and variety of punctuation, while the generated rule emphasizes the co-occurrence of specific punctuation types. They would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs, especially those with multiple punctuation marks but not necessarily a question mark and semicolon together, or vice versa. Therefore, they do not describe the same logic, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
