In contrast, the generated rule relies on the presence of specific positive descriptive or abstract words and the absence of disallowed repetitions of function words, focusing on lexical content and pattern-based constraints. These two rules target fundamentally different features: one is quantitative (word length variance), the other is lexical and pattern-based. While both aim to distinguish certain types of texts, their criteria do not align closely. They would rarely produce the same classification on the same input, as they measure different properties. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they are unlikely to agree on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
