The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if it contains at least one word with a hyphen connecting two parts, exemplified by \"well-known.\" The Generated Rule similarly states that the output is True if the input contains at least one hyphenated word, providing several examples (\"up-to-date,\" \"state-of-the-art,\" \"well-known,\" \"self-aware,\" \"high-quality\") and otherwise False. The core concept—identifying hyphenated words—is consistent between the two rules. The slight difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a hyphen within a single word, while the Generated Rule explicitly mentions hyphenated words, which are inherently single words with hyphens. Overall, they describe the same pattern and would produce identical classifications in most cases, making them effectively equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
