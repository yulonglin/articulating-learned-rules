The Generated rule emphasizes whether the sentence expresses a \"strong, internal emotional state or feeling\" versus describing external surroundings or objects. While both rules aim to identify emotional expression, the Ground Truth is more specific about the types of emotions and their clarity, whereas the Generated rule allows for a broader interpretation of internal feelings and explicitly excludes external descriptions. They overlap significantly but differ in phrasing and scope, leading to similar but not identical classifications.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
