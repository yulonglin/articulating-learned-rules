In contrast, the generated rule classifies based on the presence of the verb \"replied\" and escaped quotation marks (backslash-quote sequences), which are specific textual patterns rather than nesting depth. They do not target the same structural feature: the ground truth emphasizes nested quotation depth, while the generated rule emphasizes particular verbs and escape sequences. While both may sometimes coincide (e.g., nested quotes often involve \"said\" or \"replied\" and escaped quotes), they are not equivalent in identifying the same patterns or features. Therefore, they would not reliably produce the same classifications across most inputs, and their core concepts differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
