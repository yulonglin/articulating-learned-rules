The Ground Truth Rule explicitly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated Rule broadens this to include financial, economic, or investment concepts, principles, and practices, which are closely aligned but slightly more general.\n\nThey identify similar key features—financial or economic content—and would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"economic\" concepts and \"principles and practices,\" which may encompass a slightly broader or different set of texts than the Ground Truth Rule. Additionally, the phrasing differs, but the core concepts are equivalent enough that their classification logic overlaps significantly.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in intent and pattern recognition, but the slight differences in scope and phrasing prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
