In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE based solely on the presence of specific words related to understanding, sophistication, or communication, regardless of their length or other features. These rules focus on fundamentally different features—one on a numerical distribution of word lengths, the other on specific content keywords. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent. Therefore, they are largely unrelated in logic and pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
