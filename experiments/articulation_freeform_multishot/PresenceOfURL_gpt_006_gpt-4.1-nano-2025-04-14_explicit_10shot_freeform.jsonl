The ground truth specifies patterns starting with \"http\" or \"www\" explicitly, without mention of case sensitivity or other URL components. The generated rule broadens this slightly by including \"https\" (which is a common URL prefix) and explicitly states case-insensitivity, making it more flexible. Both rules focus on detecting URL patterns at the start of substrings, but the generated rule emphasizes resemblance and case insensitivity, which may lead to slight differences in classification. Overall, they identify the same key features and would produce similar results on most inputs, but the generated rule's broader scope and explicit mention of \"https\" and case-insensitivity make it slightly more inclusive.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
