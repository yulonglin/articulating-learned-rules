In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of specific keywords and a particular ending pattern (a letter followed by two alphanumeric characters). These criteria are fundamentally different: the ground truth centers on a pattern involving digits and surrounding letters, while the generated rule relies on keyword presence and a specific suffix pattern. They do not identify the same features or patterns, and their classification logic would rarely align on the same inputs. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
