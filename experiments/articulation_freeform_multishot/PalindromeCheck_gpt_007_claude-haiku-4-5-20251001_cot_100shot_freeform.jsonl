The Ground Truth rule specifies ignoring spaces and case, while the Generated rule extends this to ignore spaces, punctuation, and case, making it more comprehensive. As a result, the core concept—identifying palindromes—is the same, and they would produce identical classifications on inputs that are simple palindromes ignoring spaces and case. However, the Generated rule's broader scope (ignoring punctuation) means it may classify some strings as palindromes that the Ground Truth rule would not, or vice versa, in cases involving punctuation. Therefore, they are very similar but not perfectly equivalent, leading to a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
