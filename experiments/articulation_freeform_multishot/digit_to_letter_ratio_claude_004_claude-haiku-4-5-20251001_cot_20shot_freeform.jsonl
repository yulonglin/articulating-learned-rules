The generated rule, however, centers on the presence of specific identifiers, codes, or credentials (like phone numbers, IDs, flight numbers), which are typically characterized by certain patterns of alphanumeric sequences, but not necessarily by their ratio of digits to letters. While both rules relate to the presence of numerical or alphanumeric patterns, the ground truth emphasizes a quantitative ratio, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the qualitative presence of specific types of identifiers. They may overlap in cases where identifiers contain high digit-to-letter ratios, but they are not equivalent in core logic. Therefore, they are only loosely related and would not reliably produce the same classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
