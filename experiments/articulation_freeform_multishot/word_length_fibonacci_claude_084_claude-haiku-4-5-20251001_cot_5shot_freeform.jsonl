In contrast, the generated rule classifies text based on whether it appears gibberish or legitimate English, a qualitative, content-based feature. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; one is about a numerical pattern in word lengths, the other about the overall coherence or randomness of the text. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, as they target fundamentally different aspects of the text.
