The ground truth states \"Text contains at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" while the generated rule explicitly defines the condition as \"the input contains at least one palindromic word\" and provides examples. Both focus on the presence of at least one palindrome word as the key feature. The phrasing differs, but the core concept—detecting at least one palindrome word—is identical. Therefore, they describe the same classification logic and would produce the same outputs on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
