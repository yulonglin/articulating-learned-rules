The generated rule, however, specifies classification solely based on being an anagram of \"listen.\" While the core concept—detecting anagrams—is consistent, the ground truth encompasses multiple words, whereas the generated rule limits to just one. Therefore, they largely align in identifying \"listen\" as an anagram, but the ground truth's broader scope means they do not fully match in identifying all valid patterns. Overall, they are very similar in pattern detection but differ slightly in scope, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
