The generated rule classifies as True only if the text contains 2 or fewer words, and as False if 3 or more words. While both rules focus on the number of words, they differ in their thresholds: the ground truth allows up to 4 words for True, whereas the generated rule restricts True to only 2 words. This means the generated rule will classify some inputs with 3 or 4 words as False, whereas the ground truth would classify them as True. Therefore, they do not identify the same key pattern and will produce different classifications on inputs with 3 or 4 words. The core concept of counting words is similar, but the specific thresholds differ, leading to only partial overlap in classification behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
