The ground truth rule specifies that the input is labeled True if any character appears two or more times consecutively (e.g., \"oo\", \"ss\"), focusing on immediate adjacency. The generated rule states that the input is True if any letter appears more than once anywhere in the word, regardless of whether the repetitions are consecutive (e.g., \"success\" has multiple repeated letters, but not necessarily consecutive).  \n\nIn most cases, these rules will produce the same classification—for example, words with consecutive repeated characters will also have repeated letters elsewhere, and words with non-consecutive repeated letters will be classified as True by the generated rule but False by the ground truth rule. However, the key difference is that the ground truth rule is stricter, only considering consecutive repetitions, while the generated rule considers any repeated letter, whether consecutive or not.  \n\nTherefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned. The core concept of detecting repeated characters is shared, but the specific pattern (consecutive vs. any repetition) differs slightly.  \n\nOverall, the rules are close in intent but not identical in logic, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
