The Generated rule, however, specifies that the presence of the word \"Meeting\" followed by a date pattern is necessary for a positive classification, and negative otherwise. While both rules involve detecting dates, the key difference is that the Ground Truth does not require the presence of the word \"Meeting\" or any specific context, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes a particular phrase (\"Meeting\") as a trigger. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would likely produce different classifications on many inputs—especially those containing dates without the word \"Meeting\" or those mentioning \"Meeting\" without a date. The core concept of detecting dates is shared, but the contextual emphasis differs significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
