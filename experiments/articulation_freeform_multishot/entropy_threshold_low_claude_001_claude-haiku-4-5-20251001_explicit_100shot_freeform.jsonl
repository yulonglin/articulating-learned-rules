The generated rule, however, describes qualitative features such as repetition of words or letters, brevity, and lack of meaningful content, without explicitly referencing entropy or statistical measures. While both rules aim to identify repetitive or predictable text, the ground truth emphasizes a formal, measurable criterion, whereas the generated rule relies on heuristic, pattern-based descriptions. They overlap conceptually in targeting repetition and predictability but differ significantly in their approach and specificity. Therefore, they are only partially aligned and would not necessarily produce identical classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
