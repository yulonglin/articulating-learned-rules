The Ground Truth emphasizes words with alternating uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., 'aBcDeF'), which is a specific pattern of case variation. The Generated Rule broadens this to any word that appears in different cases (e.g., 'jumps' and 'JuMpS', or 'ReSuLt'), regardless of whether the case pattern is strictly alternating or just inconsistent.\n\nKey similarities:\n- Both rules classify as True when a word appears in multiple case forms.\n- Both classify as False when no such variation exists.\n\nKey differences:\n- The Ground Truth specifies a particular pattern (alternating case), while the Generated Rule considers any case variation.\n- The Generated Rule includes a condition about words appearing more than once in different cases, which aligns with the idea of case variation but is phrased differently.\n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in concept but differ in the specificity of the pattern they detect. The generated rule is more inclusive, potentially capturing more cases of case variation than the ground truth's specific pattern.\n\nTherefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5918367346938775,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.5918367346938775},"parse_error":false}
