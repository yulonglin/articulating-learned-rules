The generated rule, however, requires both the presence of specific keywords (\"output\", \"test\", \"code\", \"run\", \"check\", \"data\") and certain punctuation marks (exclamation, question, or period) to classify as positive. This introduces an additional keyword condition not present in the ground truth, and it considers multiple punctuation types rather than just sequences of identical punctuation. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would not produce the same classifications on most inputs. The core concept of detecting punctuation emphasis is shared only partially, but the inclusion of keywords in the generated rule makes their logic substantially different.","functional_test_accuracy":0.54,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":27,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.54},"parse_error":false}
