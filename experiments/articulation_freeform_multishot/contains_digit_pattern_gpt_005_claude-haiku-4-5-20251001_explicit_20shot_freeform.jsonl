The generated rule, however, classifies inputs as True if they contain **any number with three or more digits**, which includes numbers with four or more digits, not just exactly three. This broadens the pattern and does not match the strictness of the ground truth. Additionally, the generated rule notes that entries with fewer than three digits are False, aligning somewhat with the ground truth, but the key difference is the focus on \"exactly three\" versus \"three or more.\" Therefore, while both rules consider digit sequences, they do not identify the same key feature, and their classifications would differ in cases with numbers longer than three digits.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
