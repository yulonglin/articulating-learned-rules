The Ground Truth specifies nesting at least two levels deep (e.g., quotes within quotes within quotes), focusing on the depth of nesting. The Generated rule broadly captures nested or escaped quotes, which includes multiple levels but also encompasses cases with only a single level of quotation marks if they involve escaping. While they largely overlap in identifying complex quoted structures, the Ground Truth emphasizes a specific nesting depth, whereas the Generated rule is more general about the presence of nested or escaped quotes. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned in criteria, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
