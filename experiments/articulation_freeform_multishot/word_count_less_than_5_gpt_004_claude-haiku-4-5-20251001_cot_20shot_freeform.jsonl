The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain 1-2 words and do not include certain specific words, which is a much narrower and more restrictive condition. They do not identify the same key features or patterns; the ground truth emphasizes length, while the generated rule emphasizes both length and exclusion of specific words. Consequently, they would produce different classifications on most inputs, especially those with 3-4 words or those containing excluded words. The core concept of length-based classification is only loosely related, and the phrasing differs significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
