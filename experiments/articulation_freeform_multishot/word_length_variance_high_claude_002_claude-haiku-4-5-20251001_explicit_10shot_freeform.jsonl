This approach is purely quantitative and does not depend on specific word patterns or vocabulary complexity.\n\nIn contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE based on a specific syntactic pattern (\"I am [adjective] [noun]\") and the complexity of the vocabulary used in those words. It relies on pattern matching and vocabulary sophistication rather than statistical measures of word length variability.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify \"complex\" or \"inconsistent\" language features, they do so through fundamentally different criteria—one statistical, the other pattern-based. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., complex vocabulary often has longer words, which could increase variance), but they are not equivalent in logic or implementation.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications would often differ on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
