In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of at least three consecutive short words (1-2 characters), emphasizing a pattern of short, consecutive words rather than a particular numerical sequence. While both rules involve word length considerations, their core features differ: one targets a Fibonacci pattern in word lengths, the other targets consecutive short words. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ on most inputs. Therefore, they are not equivalent in concept or application.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
