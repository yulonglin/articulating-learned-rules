In contrast, the generated rule classifies an input as True only if it contains at least one word with an exclamation mark embedded within it, focusing on internal placement rather than total count. They do not identify the same key features: the ground truth emphasizes total exclamation mark count, while the generated rule emphasizes internal placement within words. Consequently, they would produce different classifications on many inputs, especially those with multiple exclamation marks outside words or with only one embedded exclamation mark. The core concepts differ significantly, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
