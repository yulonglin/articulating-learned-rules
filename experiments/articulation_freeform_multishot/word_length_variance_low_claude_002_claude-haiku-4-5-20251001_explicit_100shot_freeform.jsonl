This implies that all words tend to have similar lengths, indicating a consistent word length distribution. In contrast, the generated rule classifies text based on the presence or absence of long/uncommon words, with a focus on whether all words are short and common or if any are long/uncommon.\n\nWhile both rules relate to word length, they do so from different perspectives:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes the overall distribution and consistency of word lengths, regardless of specific word types.  \n- The generated rule relies on a binary presence/absence of long/uncommon words, which is a more coarse and categorical approach.\n\nThey may produce similar classifications in some cases—texts with uniformly short words will likely have low variance and contain only short words, aligning both rules. However, they can diverge significantly:  \n- Texts with mixed word lengths but a low variance (e.g., all words of similar but not short length) would be classified as TRUE by the ground truth but FALSE by the generated rule if they contain any long/uncommon words.  \n- Conversely, texts with mostly short words but a few longer words could have a low variance (if the longer words are not too long) and be classified as TRUE by the ground truth, but the generated rule might classify them as FALSE if any long/uncommon words are present.\n\nOverall, the core concept of \"word length consistency\" differs from \"absence of long/uncommon words,\" making the rules related but not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
