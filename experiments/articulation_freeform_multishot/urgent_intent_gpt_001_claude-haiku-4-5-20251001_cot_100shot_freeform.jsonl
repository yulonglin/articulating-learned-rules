The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the urgency and the need for prompt response. The Generated Rule expands this to include \"life-threatening\" and \"time-critical\" situations, and explicitly mentions preventing harm or damage, which broadens the scope slightly but remains aligned with urgency and immediacy. Both rules exclude routine or casual communications. However, the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"life-threatening\" and \"prevent harm\" introduces additional specific features not explicitly stated in the Ground Truth, and its phrasing is more detailed. Overall, they target similar core concepts—urgent, immediate action—but the Generated Rule is somewhat more comprehensive. Therefore, they are largely aligned but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
