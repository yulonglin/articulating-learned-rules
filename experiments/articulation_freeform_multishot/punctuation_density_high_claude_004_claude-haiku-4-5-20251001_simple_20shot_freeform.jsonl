It emphasizes a quantitative threshold based on punctuation density.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, centers on the qualitative nature and emotional tone created by specific punctuation patterns—such as multiple ellipses, question marks, and exclamation points—that evoke hesitation, uncertainty, or emotional intensity. It considers the context and effect of punctuation rather than just its quantity.  \n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their key features differ: one is a numerical threshold (percentage of punctuation), the other is the stylistic and emotional interpretation of punctuation usage. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., texts with lots of punctuation might also create emotional effects), but they do not identify the same patterns or features comprehensively. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core logic and would likely produce different classifications on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
