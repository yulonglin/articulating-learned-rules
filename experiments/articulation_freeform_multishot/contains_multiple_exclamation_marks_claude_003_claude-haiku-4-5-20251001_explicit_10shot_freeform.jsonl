It focuses solely on the count of exclamation marks.\n\nThe Generated Rule, however, classifies a text as True only if it contains at least one word with an internal exclamation mark (e.g., \"hel!lo\"), explicitly excluding exclamation marks at the end of words or standalone punctuation. It does not consider the total number of exclamation marks in the text, only the presence of internal ones within words.\n\nBecause the core features differ—one counts total exclamation marks, the other looks for internal exclamation marks within words—the two rules will often produce different classifications. For example, a text with two exclamation marks at the end of words (e.g., \"Hello! World!\") would be True under the Ground Truth but False under the Generated Rule if no internal exclamation marks are present.\n\nWhile both rules involve exclamation marks, their criteria are not equivalent, and they do not identify the same patterns or produce identical classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
