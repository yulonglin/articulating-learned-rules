The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses finance, money, banking, or investments, capturing the general domain. The Generated rule specifies that statements related to personal finance, banking, investments, financial markets, or money management are classified as True, and unrelated leisure or hobby topics as False. While the Generated rule adds more detailed categories and explicitly excludes non-finance topics, the core concept—distinguishing finance-related content from unrelated topics—is aligned. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly mentions certain categories and excludes others, whereas the Ground Truth is more general. Therefore, they largely identify the same key features and would produce similar classifications on most inputs, but the Generated rule's specificity makes it slightly more detailed.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
