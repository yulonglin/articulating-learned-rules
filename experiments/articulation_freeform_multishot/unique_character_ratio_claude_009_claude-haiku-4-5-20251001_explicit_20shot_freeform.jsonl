The generated rule, however, focuses on a qualitative pattern: whether the text is a repetition of a single character or contains multiple distinct words/phrases. While both rules tend to identify highly repetitive or low-variety text as TRUE, the ground truth rule is more precise and inclusive, capturing cases with high repetition regardless of whether the text is a single character or multiple characters with limited variety. The generated rule emphasizes specific patterns (single-character repetition) and excludes more complex or varied texts, which may not align perfectly with the ratio-based criterion. Therefore, they share some conceptual overlap but are not fully equivalent in scope or approach.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9795918367346939,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.9795918367346939},"parse_error":false}
