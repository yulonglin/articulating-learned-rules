The generated rule classifies based on the presence of gibberish versus recognizable English words, focusing on the nature of the tokens rather than their lengths or sequence patterns. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; they are based on different criteria—one on a specific numeric pattern in word lengths, the other on the semantic or lexical quality of the tokens. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
