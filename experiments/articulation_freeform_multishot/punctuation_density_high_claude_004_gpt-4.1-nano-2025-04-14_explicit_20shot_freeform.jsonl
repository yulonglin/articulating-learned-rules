In contrast, the generated rule centers on specific punctuation patterns—such as exclamation marks following ellipses or question marks, multiple exclamation marks, or combinations like '?!'—to indicate emphasis or emotion. These rules target different features: one measures overall punctuation density, the other identifies particular punctuation sequences. They do not necessarily produce the same classifications; a text with heavy punctuation but no specific patterns would be classified differently, and vice versa. Therefore, they are not equivalent in key features, patterns, or core concepts.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
