The generated rule, however, focuses on the structure of the input (single word/interjection or repeated words) and the presence of multiple different words, which is a different aspect of pattern detection. While both rules tend to identify repetitive or predictable inputs, the ground truth rule is more nuanced, capturing any low-entropy text regardless of word boundaries, whereas the generated rule explicitly considers word-level repetition and structure. They may produce similar classifications in some cases (e.g., repeated words with predictable characters), but they are not equivalent in core logic or in handling diverse inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
