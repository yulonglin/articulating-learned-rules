The generated rule, however, requires both a URL (with 'www', 'http://', or 'https://') and the presence of at least one technical/data-related term (e.g., \"input,\" \"output,\" \"result,\" etc.) to classify as true. This introduces an additional condition that is not present in the ground truth. As a result, the generated rule is more restrictive and will produce different classifications in many cases—specifically, it will classify as false when the URL is present but the technical term is absent, which the ground truth would classify as true. Therefore, while they share some common elements (URL detection), their core logic differs significantly, leading to only partial overlap in classification behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
