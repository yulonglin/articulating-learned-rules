The Ground Truth rule states that the text discusses finance-related topics, while the Generated rule emphasizes that true examples relate to financial concepts and activities involving money management or investment, with false examples being non-financial. They identify similar key features—financial or economic relevance—and would generally produce consistent classifications. However, the Generated rule explicitly mentions the distinction between true and false examples, adding a layer of pattern recognition that the Ground Truth rule does not specify. This slight difference in framing and emphasis accounts for the score not being a perfect 10, but overall, they describe very similar classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
