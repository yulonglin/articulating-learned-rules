It focuses on counting the total number of such punctuation marks anywhere in the string, regardless of position or context.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes the placement of special characters—specifically that they are embedded within or between words, not just at the end. It suggests that the special characters must interrupt the text rather than simply terminate it, and it implicitly considers their position relative to words rather than just their presence and count.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation marks from the same set, their core features differ:  \n- The ground truth rule is about the *quantity* of punctuation marks.  \n- The generated rule is about the *positioning* of special characters within the string, requiring them to be embedded rather than terminal.\n\nThey may produce similar classifications in some cases—e.g., strings with multiple embedded punctuation marks—but they can diverge significantly when the punctuation is at the end or scattered in a way that doesn't meet the \"embedded\" criterion. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic, and the generated rule introduces a positional constraint not present in the ground truth.\n\nOverall, the core concept of counting punctuation is different from the concept of placement within the string, leading to a partial overlap but not equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
