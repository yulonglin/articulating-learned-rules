The generated rule, however, classifies a text as True if it contains at least one alphabetic character immediately adjacent to a punctuation mark from the set, which is a different pattern—it's about local adjacency rather than overall punctuation count. These rules do not identify the same key features: the ground truth emphasizes the total number of punctuation marks, while the generated rule emphasizes a specific adjacency pattern involving alphabetic characters and punctuation. They would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs, especially those with multiple punctuation marks but no adjacent alphabetic characters, or vice versa. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their logical conditions differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
