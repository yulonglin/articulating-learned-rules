The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadly classifies texts containing negative or problematic aspects as True, and positive or neutral ones as False. They share the core concept of detecting negativity or issues related to the subject. However, the Ground Truth specifies explicit statements of dissatisfaction, which may be more restrictive, whereas the Generated Rule could include implicit or less direct negative mentions. Despite this nuance, the core logic aligns closely, leading to a high similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
