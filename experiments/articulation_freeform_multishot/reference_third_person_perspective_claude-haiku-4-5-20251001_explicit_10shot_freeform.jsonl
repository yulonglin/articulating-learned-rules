The Ground Truth emphasizes third-person pronouns (\"he,\" \"she,\" \"they,\" \"them\") as indicators of human-centered descriptions, which is a specific linguistic feature. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any sentences describing actions, decisions, or states involving people, regardless of explicit pronouns, and explicitly states that scenes or objects without human agency are classified as false. \n\nWhile the core concept—distinguishing human-centered content from scene/object-centered content—is aligned, the generated rule relies on a more general understanding of human involvement rather than specific pronoun usage. This may lead to slight differences in classification, especially in cases where human agency is implied but not explicitly mentioned, or where pronouns are absent but the context indicates human involvement.\n\nOverall, they share the same fundamental logic but differ slightly in the features they prioritize (pronouns vs. implied human agency), leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
