This is a straightforward pattern focusing solely on the case of alphabetic characters.\n\nThe generated rule, however, requires the presence of at least one all-uppercase word *and* at least one keyword from a specific set (e.g., INPUT, OUTPUT, etc.). It also considers the input False if it is entirely lowercase or lacks sufficient uppercase keywords. This introduces additional conditions beyond just uppercase characters: it emphasizes specific keywords and the presence of at least one uppercase word, not necessarily the entire input.\n\nWhile both rules involve uppercase patterns, the ground truth rule is simpler and only checks for all uppercase characters, whereas the generated rule involves the presence of uppercase words *and* specific keywords, making it more complex and not directly equivalent. They may produce similar results in some cases (e.g., all uppercase input with keywords), but they are not functionally identical.\n\nOverall, they share a core concept of uppercase detection but differ significantly in scope and specific criteria, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
