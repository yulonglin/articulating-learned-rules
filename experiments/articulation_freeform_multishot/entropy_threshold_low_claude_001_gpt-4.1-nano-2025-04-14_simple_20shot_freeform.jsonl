This captures a broad measure of character distribution uniformity, regardless of specific character types or content structure.\n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses on specific features: whether the input contains only lowercase letters, punctuation, or repeated characters, and excludes uppercase letters or words indicating general statements. It emphasizes simplicity, lowercase usage, and repetition, and explicitly excludes more complex or mixed-case inputs.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify \"simple\" or \"predictable\" texts, the ground truth rule is more general, relying on entropy to measure overall character predictability, whereas the generated rule applies more specific, heuristic-based criteria. They may overlap on many inputs (e.g., simple lowercase repetitive texts), but they can diverge on more complex or mixed-content inputs.\n\nTherefore, they describe related but not identical classification logic, with some core conceptual overlap but differing in scope and specific features considered.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
