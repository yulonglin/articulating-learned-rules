All True cases end with a 3-character alphanumeric code (letter-digit-letter pattern: n3o, o8i, q2b, w1t, i0a)\n2. All True cases contain lowercase words (programming/common terms)\n3.

The generated rule, however, specifies a very particular pattern: a 3-character code at the end of the input in the format letter-digit-letter, combined with the presence of lowercase words without standard sentence capitalization. These are fundamentally different features: the ground truth looks for a pattern anywhere in the text involving digits surrounded by letters, while the generated rule looks for a specific code at the end and a stylistic feature (lack of capitalization). They do not identify the same key features, and their classification criteria would often differ, especially since the generated rule's pattern is more restrictive and specific. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or likely to produce the same classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
