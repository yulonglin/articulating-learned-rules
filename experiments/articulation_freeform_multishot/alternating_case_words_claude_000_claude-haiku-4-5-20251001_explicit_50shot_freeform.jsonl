The Ground Truth specifies \"letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase,\" which is a stricter pattern requiring a specific sequence (e.g., 'aBcDeF'), whereas the Generated Rule states that a word must have both uppercase and lowercase letters, regardless of order. Despite this subtle difference, in practical terms, both rules will classify words with mixed case as True and words with only one case as False. Therefore, they largely overlap in identifying the same key feature—presence of mixed case within a word. The main difference is the specificity of the pattern, but for most inputs, they will produce the same classification. Hence, the similarity is high, warranting a score of 9.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
