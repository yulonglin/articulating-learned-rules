The Ground Truth specifies \"a sequence of three or more identical punctuation marks,\" which is precise and clear. The Generated Rule broadens this by including \"multiple consecutive punctuation marks\" and also considers texts that \"end with multiple punctuation characters,\" which may include sequences shorter than three or sequences at the end, potentially capturing some cases not covered by the original rule. While the core concept—detecting repeated punctuation—is shared, the generated rule's inclusion of ending with multiple punctuation marks and the use of \"multiple\" (which may be interpreted differently) introduces slight differences. Overall, they largely target the same pattern but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
