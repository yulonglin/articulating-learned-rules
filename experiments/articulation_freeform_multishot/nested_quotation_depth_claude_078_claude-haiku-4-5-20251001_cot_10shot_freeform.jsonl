It emphasizes the structural nesting of quotes in the text. The generated rule, however, centers on the presence of escaped quotation marks (e.g., \\\") within the text, regardless of nesting or structure. While both rules relate to quotation marks, they target different features: one looks for nested quotes, the other for escaped quotes. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., nested quotes often involve escaped quotes), but they are not equivalent in core concept or pattern detection. Therefore, they are only partially aligned and would not necessarily produce identical classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
