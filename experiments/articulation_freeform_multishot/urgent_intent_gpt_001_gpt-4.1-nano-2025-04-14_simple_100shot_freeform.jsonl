The Ground Truth emphasizes an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the presence of urgency and directness. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"urgent, emergency-related language or phrases indicating immediate danger, assistance, or action is required,\" which aligns with the core concept of urgency and emergency. However, the Generated Rule explicitly mentions specific language cues and may include a wider range of phrases, potentially capturing more messages than the Ground Truth. Despite slight differences in phrasing and scope, the core concepts—urgent, immediate need for action—are aligned, making them largely equivalent in intent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
