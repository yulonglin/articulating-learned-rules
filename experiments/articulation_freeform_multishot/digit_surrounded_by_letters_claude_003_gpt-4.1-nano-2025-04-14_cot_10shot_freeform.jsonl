The generated rule, however, describes classification based on the presence of a word containing a sequence of exactly three consecutive characters forming a recognizable pattern, which is a much broader and different criterion. They do not identify the same key features; the ground truth emphasizes a particular digit-letter adjacency pattern, while the generated rule centers on a pattern of three consecutive characters within words. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
