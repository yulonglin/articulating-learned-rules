The generated rule, however, specifies that a text is True only if it contains at least one exclamation mark immediately adjacent to a sequence of alphabetic characters. This introduces a positional and contextual constraint that is not present in the ground truth. As a result, the generated rule may exclude texts with multiple exclamation marks that are not directly next to alphabetic sequences, and may include texts with a single exclamation mark adjacent to letters, which the ground truth would classify as False if only one exclamation mark is present. Therefore, while both rules involve exclamation marks, their core patterns differ significantly, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
