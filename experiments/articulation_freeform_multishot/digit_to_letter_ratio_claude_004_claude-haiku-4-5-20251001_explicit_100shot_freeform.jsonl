It emphasizes a quantitative measure based on character composition.\n\nThe generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains a *specific, formal identifier* or a *complete date-time stamp*, emphasizing the presence of explicit, unique identifiers or precise temporal information. It relies on the nature of the content (formal codes or full date-times) rather than a numerical ratio.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify \"substantial\" or \"specific\" content, their key features differ:  \n- The ground truth is pattern-based, based on character ratios.  \n- The generated rule is content-based, based on the presence of formal identifiers or complete date-times.\n\nThey may overlap in some cases (e.g., a serial number with many digits might also have a high digit-to-letter ratio), but generally, they target different aspects of the text. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications would often differ.\n\nHence, the score reflects that they are related in intent but fundamentally different in approach and key features.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
