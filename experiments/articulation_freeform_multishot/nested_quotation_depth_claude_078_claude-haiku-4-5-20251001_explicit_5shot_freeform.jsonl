This emphasizes the depth of nesting of quotes as the key feature. In contrast, the generated rule focuses solely on the presence of an escaped quote (`\\\"`) within quoted speech, regardless of nesting depth. While both rules involve quoted text, the ground truth emphasizes nesting levels, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of escape characters within quotes. They may overlap in some cases—texts with nested quotes often contain escaped quotes—but they are not equivalent in scope or focus. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications may differ on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
