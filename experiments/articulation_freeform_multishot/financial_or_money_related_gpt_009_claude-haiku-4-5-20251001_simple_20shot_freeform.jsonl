The Ground Truth rule specifies topics explicitly (finance, money, banking, investments), focusing on the subject matter. The Generated rule broadens this to include \"financial, economic, or investment-related concepts, principles, or activities,\" which aligns closely but slightly expands the scope. Both rules agree that non-financial topics like hobbies or travel should be classified as false. The main difference is the phrasing and slight broadening in the generated rule, but the core concept—distinguishing financial/economic content from non-financial—is essentially the same. Therefore, they are highly aligned, with a minor difference in scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
