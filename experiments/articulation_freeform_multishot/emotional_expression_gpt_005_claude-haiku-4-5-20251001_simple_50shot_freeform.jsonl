The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the emotional content itself. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"strong emotional states or feelings\" like joy, sadness, anger, fear, pride, or excitement, and explicitly states that the output is True when such feelings are described, and False otherwise. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting emotional content—is similar, the Generated Rule introduces additional emotions (fear, pride) and emphasizes the strength of the feeling, which may lead to slight differences in classification. Additionally, the Generated Rule explicitly excludes neutral observations, physical actions, or sensory details without emotional content, aligning with the idea of identifying emotional states but with more detailed criteria.\n\nOverall, they largely overlap in identifying emotional expressions but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
