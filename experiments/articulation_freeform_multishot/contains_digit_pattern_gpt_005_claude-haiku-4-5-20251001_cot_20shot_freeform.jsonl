The ground truth specifies \"a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits,\" which can be interpreted as three digits appearing in a row, regardless of whether they form a standalone number or are part of a longer string. The generated rule explicitly states \"a 3-digit number,\" which is a contiguous sequence of exactly three digits forming a number. \n\nThe key difference is that the ground truth might include any occurrence of three consecutive digits, even if they are part of a longer digit sequence (e.g., \"1234\" contains \"123\" and \"234\"), whereas the generated rule focuses on a standalone 3-digit number, which could be interpreted as a sequence of exactly three digits that form a number, possibly requiring delimiters or context to distinguish from longer digit sequences.\n\nDespite this subtle distinction, in most practical scenarios, both rules will classify inputs similarly—detecting three consecutive digits or a 3-digit number—leading to a high degree of overlap in their classifications. Therefore, they are conceptually very similar, but not perfectly identical in phrasing or potential edge cases.\n\nOverall, the core concept is aligned, but slight differences in interpretation prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
