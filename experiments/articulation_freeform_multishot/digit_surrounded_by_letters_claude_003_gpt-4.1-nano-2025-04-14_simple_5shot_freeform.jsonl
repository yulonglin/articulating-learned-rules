The generated rule states that the output is True if the input contains at least one lowercase word that includes a digit, regardless of surrounding characters, and False otherwise. While both rules involve digits within words, the ground truth emphasizes the specific pattern of a digit flanked by letters, whereas the generated rule only requires the presence of a digit within a lowercase word, without regard to neighboring characters. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features and would not always produce the same classification, especially in cases where digits are present but not surrounded by letters as specified in the ground truth.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
