It focuses on the case of individual characters within the entire input string, requiring all alphabetic characters to be uppercase.\n\nThe generated rule classifies an input as True only if all words are in uppercase, which implies that every contiguous sequence of characters separated by spaces is uppercase. This is a more restrictive condition, as it depends on word boundaries and the case of entire words rather than individual characters.\n\nWhile both rules require uppercase characters, the ground truth allows for mixed case within words as long as all alphabetic characters are uppercase, and only requires at least one letter. The generated rule requires entire words to be uppercase, which is a stricter condition. For example, a string with mixed case within words (e.g., \"Hello WORLD\") would be classified differently: the ground truth might classify it as False if not all characters are uppercase, whereas the generated rule would classify it as False because not all words are uppercase.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of uppercase letters but differ in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9795918367346939,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.9795918367346939},"parse_error":false}
