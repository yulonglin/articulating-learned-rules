This encompasses a broader set of words, specifically all anagrams of these three words, which are different in length and letter composition. The Generated Rule, however, only classifies words as True if they are anagrams of \"listen\" specifically, ignoring \"below\" and \"study.\" Therefore, while both rules involve identifying anagrams, the Ground Truth covers a wider set of words related to three specific base words, whereas the generated rule is limited to one. They share the core concept of recognizing anagrams but differ significantly in scope and the specific patterns they identify.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
