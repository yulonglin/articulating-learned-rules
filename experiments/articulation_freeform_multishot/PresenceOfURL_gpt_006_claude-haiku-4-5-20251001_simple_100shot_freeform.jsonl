The Generated Rule, however, requires both a URL (specifically with protocols like https://, http://, or www.) and at least one positive indicator word from a predefined set, making it more restrictive. While both rules involve URL detection, the generated rule adds an additional condition based on specific words, which the ground truth does not specify. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications will differ on many inputs—particularly those with URLs but lacking positive words, or vice versa. The core concept of URL detection is shared, but the inclusion of the word condition makes them only partially aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
