The generated rule, on the other hand, focuses on the presence of repeated units (characters, syllables, or words) appearing at least three times, emphasizing repetition at the unit level rather than character diversity. While both rules relate to repetition, they target different aspects: the ground truth assesses overall character diversity, whereas the generated rule looks for explicit repeated units. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., highly repetitive text), but generally, they identify different patterns and are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
