In contrast, the generated rule specifies a qualitative pattern requiring the presence of an ellipsis combined with either a question mark or multiple exclamation marks, focusing on specific punctuation features rather than overall punctuation density. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; the first emphasizes overall punctuation proportion, while the second emphasizes particular punctuation combinations. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
