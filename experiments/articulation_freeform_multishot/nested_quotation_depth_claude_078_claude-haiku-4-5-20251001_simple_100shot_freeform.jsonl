The Ground Truth specifies nesting at least two levels deep (e.g., `'He said \"She told me \\\"No\\\"\"'`), emphasizing the depth of nesting. The Generated Rule states that the output is **True** when nested quotes are present and **False** otherwise, with an emphasis on the presence of `\\\"` to indicate nesting.\n\nThe main difference lies in the explicit mention of nesting depth: the Ground Truth requires at least two levels of nesting, whereas the Generated Rule broadly considers any nested quotation marks (which could include just one level). However, in typical usage, nested quotes are often associated with multiple levels, and both rules focus on the presence of nested quotation marks as the key feature.\n\nTherefore, they largely identify the same pattern—nested quotes—though the Ground Truth emphasizes a minimum nesting depth, while the Generated Rule is more general. This results in a high degree of overlap, but not perfect equivalence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The rules are closely aligned in concept, with minor differences in specificity regarding nesting depth.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
