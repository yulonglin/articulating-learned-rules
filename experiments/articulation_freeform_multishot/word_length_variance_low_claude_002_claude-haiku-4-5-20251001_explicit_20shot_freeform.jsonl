In contrast, the generated rule classifies text based on the presence or absence of specific words or patterns related to vocabulary categories (concrete nouns, common words, or abstract/sophisticated words). These are fundamentally different features: one is quantitative and distributional, the other is lexical and categorical. While both rules aim to determine some aspect of the text's content, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. They would rarely produce the same classification on the same input, as their criteria are unrelated. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and the similarity in their logic is minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
