The generated rule, however, emphasizes only positive emotions, feelings, or pleasant experiences, and explicitly excludes neutral, negative, or somber moods. While there is some overlap in recognizing positive emotions, the generated rule narrows the scope to positive feelings and omits negative or neutral states that the ground truth rule considers. Therefore, they do not identify exactly the same features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs involving negative or neutral emotions. The core concept of recognizing emotional states is similar, but the specific focus and scope differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
