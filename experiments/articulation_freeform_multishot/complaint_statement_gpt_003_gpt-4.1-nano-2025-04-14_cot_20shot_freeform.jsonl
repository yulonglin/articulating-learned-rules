The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on direct language indicating dissatisfaction. The Generated Rule broadens this to include expressions of complaints, problems, or negative experiences, which may encompass implicit or less direct negative sentiments. While they largely overlap, the Generated Rule might classify some statements as negative that do not explicitly state dissatisfaction (e.g., subtle complaints), and the Ground Truth emphasizes explicitness. Overall, they are very similar in intent and likely to produce similar classifications, but the slight difference in explicitness versus general negativity accounts for the score of 8.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
