The generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of specific identifiers or codes (like passwords, VINs, barcodes, etc.) versus general descriptive information, which is a different pattern entirely. While both rules involve identifying certain types of alphanumeric sequences, the ground truth emphasizes a quantitative ratio, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of particular types of codes or identifiers. They do not target the same features or patterns and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
