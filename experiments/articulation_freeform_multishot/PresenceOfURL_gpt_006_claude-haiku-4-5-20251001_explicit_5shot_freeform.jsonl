The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', which covers common URL patterns. The Generated Rule states that the presence of a URL (http:// or https://) determines classification, focusing on the protocol prefix. While both rules target URLs, the Ground Truth includes 'www' as a key indicator, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the protocol prefix. In most cases, URLs starting with 'http' or 'https://' will also contain 'www' if they include a subdomain, but not always. Conversely, some URLs may start with 'http' or 'https://' without 'www'. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned. The core concept—detecting URLs—is the same, but the specific patterns differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect similarity.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
