The generated rule, however, only considers whether there is at least one word containing two or more exclamation marks, which is a more restrictive condition. As a result, the generated rule may miss inputs that have multiple exclamation marks spread across different words, but not within a single word. While both rules focus on the presence of multiple exclamation marks, their key features differ: the ground truth looks at total count in the entire input, whereas the generated rule focuses on a specific pattern within individual words. Therefore, they are similar in concept but not equivalent in classification logic, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
