This focuses on the statistical measure of character variability and predictability. The generated rule, however, classifies responses based on their length and complexity—short, simple responses are TRUE; longer, complex ones are FALSE—without explicitly considering character entropy or pattern predictability. While both rules tend to favor simple, predictable texts, the generated rule does not directly measure entropy or character distribution. Therefore, they identify related but not identical features and would not always produce the same classifications, especially for texts that are short but contain complex or unpredictable character patterns, or vice versa.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
