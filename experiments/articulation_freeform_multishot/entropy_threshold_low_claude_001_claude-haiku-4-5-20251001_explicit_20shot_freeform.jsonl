This approach focuses on the statistical properties of the text's character usage, which often correlates with simplicity or repetition.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies based on semantic and structural features—whether the text is a simple exclamation, interjection, or single/short utterance versus a proverb or idiom. This is a qualitative, content-based criterion rather than a statistical one.\n\nWhile both rules tend to identify simple, short, or repetitive texts as TRUE and more complex, meaningful expressions as FALSE, they do so via different mechanisms. The entropy-based rule is more objective and quantifiable, whereas the generated rule relies on semantic interpretation, which can be subjective and context-dependent.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications may diverge on many inputs, especially those that are short but semantically complex or repetitive but not simple utterances.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are related but not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
