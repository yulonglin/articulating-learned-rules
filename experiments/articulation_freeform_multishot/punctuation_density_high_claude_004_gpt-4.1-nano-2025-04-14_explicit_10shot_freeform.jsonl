It does not consider the type, context, or emotional content of punctuation. In contrast, the generated rule emphasizes specific patterns of punctuation (e.g., sequences expressing excitement or emphasis) and their emotional or contextual significance, rather than their quantity. While both rules involve punctuation, their criteria are fundamentally different: one is quantitative (percentage-based), the other qualitative (context and intent). They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, especially in edge cases. Therefore, they do not describe the same logic, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
