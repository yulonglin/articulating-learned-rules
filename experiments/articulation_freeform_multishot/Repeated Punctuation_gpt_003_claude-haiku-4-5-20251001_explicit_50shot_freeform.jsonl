The generated rule, however, considers the presence of certain punctuation marks (`!`, `?`, `.`) and emphasizes their position (end or within the text) to infer emphasis, excitement, or questioning tone, but it does not specifically require multiple identical punctuation marks in sequence. Instead, it broadly includes any occurrence of these marks, with some mention of multiple periods (`...`) as a sign of emphasis.\n\nThese differences mean:\n- The ground truth is strict about consecutive identical punctuation (e.g., '!!!'), whereas the generated rule is more permissive, considering any occurrence of `!`, `?`, or `.`.\n- The generated rule may classify texts as positive based on single punctuation marks or their placement, not necessarily sequences of three or more identical marks.\n- Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs, especially those with single punctuation marks or different punctuation patterns.\n\nOverall, the core concept of requiring multiple identical punctuation marks is not captured by the generated rule, making their equivalence minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
