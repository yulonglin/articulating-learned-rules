In contrast, the generated rule describes a classification based on the presence of words composed solely of lowercase letters and digits, with a total length threshold, and explicitly excludes uppercase letters and special characters. These rules differ significantly in their key features: the ground truth emphasizes local digit-letter adjacency, while the generated rule emphasizes the composition and length of certain words. They may occasionally overlap if such patterns coincide, but generally, they identify different patterns and would not reliably produce the same classifications across diverse inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
