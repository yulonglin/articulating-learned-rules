The Ground Truth specifies that any word is an anagram of common words like \"listen,\" \"below,\" or \"study,\" implying a broad set of reference words. The Generated Rule narrows this down to specific examples (\"enlist\" and \"listen\") and generalizes that True cases are words that are anagrams of each other or a specific word, while False cases are not.  \n\nThey share the core concept of detecting anagrams as the primary feature. However, the Ground Truth emphasizes a broader, more inclusive set of common words, whereas the Generated Rule centers on specific examples and a general pattern of anagrammatic relationships. This difference means they would largely produce similar classifications when the input words are related to the specified common words, but may diverge on words outside that set.  \n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying anagrams is equivalent, but the scope and phrasing differ, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
