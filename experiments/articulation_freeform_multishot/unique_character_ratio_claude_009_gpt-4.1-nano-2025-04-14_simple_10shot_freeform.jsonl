This captures a broad pattern: texts with many repeated characters or limited diversity.\n\nThe generated rule specifically identifies texts containing a repeated single letter (or sequence) at least four times, possibly separated by spaces or punctuation. This is a narrower pattern focusing on explicit repeated characters, not necessarily capturing the overall character diversity or the ratio of unique to total characters.\n\nWhile both rules relate to repetition, the ground truth rule considers overall character variety, whereas the generated rule targets specific repeated sequences. They may agree on many inputs with obvious repetition but can diverge in cases where the text has limited character variety without explicit repeated sequences, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, they share a conceptual focus on repetition but differ in scope and specific patterns, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
