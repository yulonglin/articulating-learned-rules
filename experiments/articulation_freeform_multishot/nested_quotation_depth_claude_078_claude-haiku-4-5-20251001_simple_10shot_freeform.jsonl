The Ground Truth specifies that the text must contain quoted sections nested at least two levels deep, exemplified by nested quotes like 'He said \"She told me \\\"No\\\"\"'. The Generated Rule states that the output is **True** when the input contains nested quotation marks (indicated by escaped quotes `\\\"`) and **False** otherwise, focusing on the presence of nesting rather than depth.\n\nThe key difference is that the Ground Truth explicitly requires at least two levels of nesting, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of nested quotes (which may or may not be at least two levels deep). If the generated rule considers any nesting (including just one level) as positive, it might classify some inputs differently from the ground truth, which requires at least two levels.\n\nDespite this, both rules center on detecting nested quotation marks, and in many cases, they would produce the same classification—especially when nesting is clearly present or absent. The core concept of identifying nested quotes is aligned, but the specificity regarding nesting depth introduces some divergence.\n\nOverall, they are closely related but not perfectly equivalent, hence a score of 7.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
