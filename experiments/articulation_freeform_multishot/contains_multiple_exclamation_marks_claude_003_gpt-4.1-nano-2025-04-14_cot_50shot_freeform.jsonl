The generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of at least one word with embedded or interleaved exclamation marks, which suggests a focus on the pattern or placement of exclamation marks within words rather than their total count. While both rules involve exclamation marks as a key feature, the ground truth is based on quantity, and the generated rule is based on the pattern or embedding within words.  \n\nIn many cases, inputs with multiple exclamation marks will also have at least one word with embedded or interleaved exclamation marks, so they would often agree. However, there could be inputs with fewer than two exclamation marks overall but with a word containing embedded exclamation marks, leading to potential classification differences. Conversely, inputs with two or more exclamation marks scattered throughout but no embedded or interleaved ones might be classified differently.\n\nOverall, the core concept of using exclamation marks as a feature is shared, but the specific patterns and counts differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
