The ground truth emphasizes \"words that read the same forwards and backwards,\" and the generated rule explicitly states \"a word that is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).\" The core concept of detecting at least one palindrome word is consistent. The main difference is in phrasing: the ground truth mentions \"text contains at least one word,\" while the generated rule clarifies the classification condition explicitly. Overall, they describe essentially the same pattern and would produce identical classifications in most cases, making them highly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
