The generated rule, however, focuses on the presence of repeated words, letters, or sequences occurring multiple times, implying a pattern of repetition but at a higher linguistic or sequence level rather than purely character diversity. While both rules involve repetition, the ground truth centers on character diversity, whereas the generated rule emphasizes repeated elements (words or sequences). They may overlap in some cases—texts with high repetition at the character level often contain repeated sequences—but generally, they target different features. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce identical classifications consistently, and their core concepts are only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
