The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain exactly one word, and False if more than one word. These rules differ significantly: the ground truth allows multiple words (up to 4), while the generated rule only accepts a single word. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and would produce different classifications for inputs with 2-4 words.
