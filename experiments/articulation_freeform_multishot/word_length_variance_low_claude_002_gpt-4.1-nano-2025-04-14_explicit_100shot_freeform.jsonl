In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE based on the presence of specific words (\"mat\" or \"cat\") and a minimum total word count, focusing on particular keywords and length threshold. These criteria are fundamentally different: one is about the statistical distribution of word lengths, the other about specific words and overall length. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classifications on the same inputs. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they are not aligned in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
