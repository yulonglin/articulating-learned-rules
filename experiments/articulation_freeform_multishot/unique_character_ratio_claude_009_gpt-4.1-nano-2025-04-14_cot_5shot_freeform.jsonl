The generated rule, however, focuses on the presence of only repeated lowercase letters separated by spaces, with no punctuation or other characters, which is a more specific pattern. While both rules aim to identify limited character variety or repetitive patterns, the ground truth rule is broader and based on a quantitative ratio, potentially capturing a wider range of repetitive or low-variability texts. The generated rule is more restrictive, requiring a specific format (repeated lowercase letters separated by spaces). Therefore, they do not identify exactly the same features and may not produce identical classifications on all inputs. They share a core concept of low character diversity but differ significantly in the specific patterns they recognize.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
