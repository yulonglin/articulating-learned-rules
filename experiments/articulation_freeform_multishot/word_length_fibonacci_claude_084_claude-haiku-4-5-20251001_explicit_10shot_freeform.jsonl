It does not consider the actual content or recognizability of the words, only their lengths. In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of gibberish or non-dictionary words, which is a qualitative, content-based feature. These rules are fundamentally different: one assesses a numerical pattern in word lengths, the other assesses the nature of the words themselves. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concepts—length pattern versus word recognizability—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
