The generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of specific words (\"Yes\" or \"Never\") within quoted speech, regardless of nesting depth or structure. These rules target different features: one on quotation nesting depth, the other on specific content within quotes. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could meet the nesting criterion without containing \"Yes\" or \"Never,\" or vice versa. The core concepts—structural nesting versus specific word content—are not equivalent, making the rules fundamentally different in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
