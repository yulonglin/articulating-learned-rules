The generated rule, however, specifies that a word must be an anagram of \"silent,\" which is a specific word with a fixed set of letters. While \"listen\" is an anagram of \"silent,\" \"below\" and \"study\" are not. Therefore, the generated rule only captures a subset of the words described by the ground truth (specifically, those anagrams of \"silent\") and excludes many others. The core concept of identifying anagrams is shared, but the specific patterns and classifications differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
