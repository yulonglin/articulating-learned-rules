In contrast, the generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains an explicit alphanumeric identifier or reference number, which is a specific pattern rather than a ratio-based criterion. While both rules relate to the presence of numerical information, the ground truth emphasizes the proportion of digits to letters, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the existence of particular types of identifiers. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., texts with explicit identifiers often have high digit-to-letter ratios), but they are not equivalent in core logic or features. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification pattern and would likely produce different results on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
