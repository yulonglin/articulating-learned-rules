The Ground Truth states that any word is an anagram of common words (listen, below, study), implying that the key feature is whether the word can be rearranged into known words. The Generated Rule specifies that true cases are words with at least one anagram in the list, and false cases are those without any anagram counterparts. They both identify the same core pattern: the presence or absence of anagrammatic relationships. The main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes the relationship to specific known words, while the Generated Rule generalizes to any anagram presence within the list. Despite this slight difference in framing, the core concept—classification based on anagram relationships—is aligned. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in logic, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
