The Ground Truth specifies that the text \"explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticizes,\" focusing on direct expressions of negative sentiment. The Generated Rule classifies based on whether the input \"expresses a complaint, problem, or negative experience\" versus positive feedback, which aligns closely with the core concept of identifying negative or critical statements. \n\nHowever, the phrasing differs slightly: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, while the Generated Rule includes broader terms like \"problem\" and \"negative experience,\" which may sometimes capture less explicit or more nuanced negative sentiments. Despite this, the core logic—distinguishing negative/critical from positive/satisfactory—is essentially the same, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
