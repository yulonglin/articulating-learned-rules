The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if there is at least one word entirely in uppercase and the total number of words is at least three. These criteria are quite different: the ground truth emphasizes the case of all alphabetic characters in the entire input, while the generated rule focuses on the presence of a fully uppercase word and a minimum number of words. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., a single uppercase word in a long sentence), but generally, they identify different patterns and would produce different classifications on many inputs. Therefore, their core concepts and key features are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
