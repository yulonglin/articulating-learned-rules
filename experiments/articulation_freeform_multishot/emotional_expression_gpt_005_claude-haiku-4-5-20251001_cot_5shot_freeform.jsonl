The Ground Truth focuses specifically on conveying a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, emphasizing the emotional content. The Generated Rule broadens this to include internal psychological states and contrasts them with external sensory perceptions, events, or physical actions, framing the classification as inner versus outer focus. While the core concept of differentiating internal emotional/psychological states from external observations is similar, the Ground Truth is more narrowly focused on explicit emotional expressions, whereas the Generated Rule encompasses a wider range of internal states and explicitly contrasts them with external perceptions. Therefore, they largely align but are not perfectly equivalent in scope or phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
