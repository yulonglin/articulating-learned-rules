The Ground Truth specifies nesting at least two levels deep, exemplified by quotes within quotes with escaped inner quotes. The Generated rule simplifies this to detecting the presence of nested quotes (a quote within a quote), which aligns with the core concept of nesting. They would largely agree on most inputs: texts with deep nesting would be classified as True, and those with only single-level quotes as False. However, the Ground Truth emphasizes a minimum nesting depth (two levels), whereas the Generated rule broadly detects any nesting, including possibly shallow ones, which could lead to slight discrepancies in borderline cases. Overall, the core concept of nested quotations is equivalent, making the rules closely aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
