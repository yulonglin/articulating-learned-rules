The generated rule, however, classifies as positive only if the date indicates a future or recent meeting date, adding a contextual criterion that the date must be relevant to a meeting schedule. Additionally, the generated rule emphasizes recognized formats that suggest a meeting date, which may include more flexible or different date expressions, but it introduces a temporal relevance condition not present in the ground truth. Therefore, while both rules focus on detecting dates, they differ significantly in the patterns considered and the contextual interpretation, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
