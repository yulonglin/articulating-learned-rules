The generated rule, however, relies on the presence of certain key words and specific ending punctuation (like \"!\", \"?\", \".\", or \",\"), without any mention of punctuation repetition patterns. These are fundamentally different features: one focuses on repeated punctuation sequences, the other on specific words and punctuation at the end. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications would often differ. The core concept of detecting repeated punctuation is not captured by the generated rule, and vice versa.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
