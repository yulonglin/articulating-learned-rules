The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include any urgent or emergency-related request or information indicating a need for immediate attention. They share core concepts of urgency and immediate response, and would likely classify most similar messages similarly. However, the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"information\" and slightly broader phrasing may lead to some differences in borderline cases, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
