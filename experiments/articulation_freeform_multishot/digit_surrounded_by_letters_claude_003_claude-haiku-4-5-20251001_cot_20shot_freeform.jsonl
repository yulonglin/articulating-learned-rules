The ground truth rule specifies \"at least one digit with a letter immediately before and after it,\" which aligns with the generated rule's pattern of a token matching a letter-digit-letter sequence. They essentially describe the same core pattern, though the ground truth emphasizes the presence of such a pattern anywhere in the text, while the generated rule specifies a token-level match. Minor differences may arise in edge cases (e.g., overlapping patterns or multiple tokens), but overall, they identify the same key feature and would produce similar classifications in most scenarios.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
