The Ground Truth explicitly states URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', while the Generated Rule broadens this to any URL containing 'http://', 'https://', or 'www.'. The core concept—detecting URLs—is consistent, and both rules rely solely on URL presence for classification. The slight difference is that the Ground Truth specifies only certain URL patterns, whereas the generated rule includes 'https://' as well, which is a common URL pattern. This makes the generated rule slightly more inclusive, but overall, they describe nearly the same logic. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in intent and outcome, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
