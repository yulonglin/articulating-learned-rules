The generated rule, however, classifies text as TRUE based on the presence of specific \"intelligent\" or \"complexity-related\" words and the absence of irrelevant or repeated words. These criteria are fundamentally different: one is a quantitative linguistic feature (variance in word lengths), and the other is a qualitative semantic/content-based feature (presence of certain words). They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs. The core concepts are not equivalent, making the rules largely unrelated in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
