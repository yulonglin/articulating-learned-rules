The generated rule, however, focuses on specific types of punctuation patterns—multiple consecutive punctuation marks, ellipses, or unconventional combinations—and explicitly states that standard, single punctuation marks in normal usage lead to a FALSE classification. While both rules relate to punctuation, the ground truth emphasizes overall punctuation density, whereas the generated rule emphasizes particular punctuation patterns and their stylistic usage. They may overlap in some cases (texts with heavy punctuation likely contain multiple or unconventional marks), but they are not fully aligned in identifying the same features or patterns. Therefore, they are only partially equivalent and would not necessarily produce identical classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
