The Ground Truth emphasizes an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which broadly covers any message requesting quick response. The Generated Rule specifies \"urgent emergency situation or critical alert requiring immediate action,\" including specific examples like medical emergencies, safety hazards, or threats, which align with the core concept of urgent, high-priority situations. \n\nHowever, the Ground Truth is somewhat more general and may include non-emergency urgent requests (e.g., urgent but non-critical requests), whereas the Generated Rule explicitly targets emergency or critical alerts. Despite this slight difference, the core concept of urgency and immediate response is consistent, leading to mostly overlapping classifications. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, resulting in a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
