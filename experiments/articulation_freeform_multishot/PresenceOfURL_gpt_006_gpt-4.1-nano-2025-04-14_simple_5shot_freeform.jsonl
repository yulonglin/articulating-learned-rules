The ground truth specifies URLs beginning with \"http\" or \"www,\" while the generated rule broadens this to include URLs starting with \"http\" or \"https\"—which is a common and reasonable extension, since \"https\" URLs are prevalent. The core concept of detecting URLs based on their starting pattern is consistent, and in most cases, they would produce similar results. However, the ground truth explicitly mentions \"www\" as a starting pattern, whereas the generated rule does not specify \"www\" explicitly, potentially missing some URLs that start with \"www\" but not \"http\" or \"https\" (e.g., \"www.example.com\" without the \"http\" prefix). Conversely, the generated rule's inclusion of \"https\" is an improvement over the ground truth, which does not mention \"https.\" Overall, the core pattern detection is similar, but slight differences in phrasing and pattern scope prevent a perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
