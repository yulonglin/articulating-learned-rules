The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the core concept of the Generated Rule. The Generated Rule specifies explicit keywords and phrases related to urgency and emergency scenarios, providing concrete patterns to detect such cases. While the Ground Truth is more general and conceptual, the Generated Rule offers a detailed pattern-based approach. They largely overlap in identifying texts that indicate urgent needs, but the Generated Rule's reliance on specific keywords may miss some cases that are urgent but do not contain the listed terms, or include false positives if the keywords are used in non-urgent contexts. Overall, they describe similar core concepts and would likely produce similar classifications most of the time, but the generated rule's explicit keyword list introduces some potential divergence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
