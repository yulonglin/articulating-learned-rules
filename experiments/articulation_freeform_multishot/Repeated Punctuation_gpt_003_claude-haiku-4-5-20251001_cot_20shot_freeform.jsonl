The generated rule, however, requires both the presence of at least one specific \"action/object\" word and any punctuation marks, which is a different criterion. They do not identify the same key features or patterns; the ground truth focuses on punctuation sequences alone, while the generated rule emphasizes specific words plus punctuation. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially when texts contain the punctuation pattern but lack the specified words, or vice versa. The core concepts are not equivalent, making their logical conditions substantially different.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
