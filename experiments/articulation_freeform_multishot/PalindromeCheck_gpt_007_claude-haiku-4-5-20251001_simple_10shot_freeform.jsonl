The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, and the generated rule extends this to ignore punctuation as well, which is a broader criterion. While this difference might cause some discrepancies on inputs with punctuation, in most cases, the core concept of identifying palindromes remains the same. The phrasing differs slightly, but the fundamental pattern they detect is equivalent. Therefore, they are very similar, with a minor difference in handling punctuation.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
