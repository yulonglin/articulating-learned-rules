The generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of repeated words, which pertains to lexical repetition. These are fundamentally different features: one focuses on word length distribution, the other on word repetition. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications across most inputs, as a text could have consistent word lengths without repeated words, or contain repeated words with high variance in word lengths. The core concepts—word length consistency versus word repetition—are not equivalent, making the two rules describe different classification criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
