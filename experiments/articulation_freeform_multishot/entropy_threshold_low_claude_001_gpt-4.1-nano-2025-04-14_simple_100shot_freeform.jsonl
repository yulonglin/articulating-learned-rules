The generated rule, however, broadly states that the input must contain only repeated sequences of a single character or simple repetitive patterns, and otherwise is FALSE. While both rules aim to identify highly predictable or repetitive texts, the ground truth focuses specifically on the entropy measure, which captures the overall predictability of character distribution, including subtle patterns. The generated rule emphasizes explicit pattern repetition (e.g., repeated characters or words) but does not explicitly consider the entropy measure or more complex patterns that might have low entropy but are not strictly repetitive. Therefore, they partially overlap in identifying repetitive or predictable texts but differ in scope and specificity, leading to some divergence in classification, especially for texts with low entropy but not strictly repetitive patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
