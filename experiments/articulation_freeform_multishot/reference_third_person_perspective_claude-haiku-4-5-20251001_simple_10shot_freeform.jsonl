The Generated rule, however, centers on whether the sentence depicts active group actions or decision-making versus passive observations or states, regardless of perspective or pronoun usage. While both rules relate to human activity and agency, they differ in key features: the Ground Truth emphasizes perspective and pronoun use, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes the nature of the action (active collaboration vs. passive scene). They may overlap in some cases but are not fully aligned in identifying the same patterns or core concepts.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
