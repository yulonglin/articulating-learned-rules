The ground truth rule considers any character that appears two or more times consecutively (e.g., \"oo\", \"ss\"), focusing on immediate adjacency. The generated rule considers any character that appears more than once anywhere in the word, regardless of whether the repetitions are consecutive (e.g., \"success\" has multiple 's's, but not necessarily consecutive). \n\nIn most cases, these rules will produce similar classifications—words with consecutive repeated characters will be classified as True, and words with only non-consecutive repeats will be classified as True under the generated rule but False under the ground truth. However, there are edge cases where they differ: for example, \"success\" would be classified as True by the generated rule (due to repeated 's'), but False by the ground truth rule if no consecutive repeats are present.\n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in intent but differ in the specific pattern they detect, leading to high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
