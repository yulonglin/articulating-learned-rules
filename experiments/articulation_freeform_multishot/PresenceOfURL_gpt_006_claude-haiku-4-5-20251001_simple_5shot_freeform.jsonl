The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', which covers URLs beginning with 'http', 'https', and URLs starting with 'www'. The Generated Rule explicitly mentions URLs starting with 'http://', 'https://', which aligns with the 'http' pattern, and implicitly includes 'www' URLs if they are recognized as URLs. However, the Generated Rule's phrasing suggests it only considers URLs starting with 'http://' or 'https://', potentially excluding URLs that start with 'www' without the 'http' prefix. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly equivalent, especially regarding URLs starting with 'www' alone. They would produce similar classifications in most cases but may differ in some edge cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
