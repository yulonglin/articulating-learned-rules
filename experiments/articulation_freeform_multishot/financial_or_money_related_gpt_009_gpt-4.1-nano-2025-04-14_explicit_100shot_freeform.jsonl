The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated rule explicitly defines the classification criteria, including financial concepts, economic phenomena, investment strategies, and market topics, which are specific aspects within the broader domain. While the core concept—identifying financial or economic content—is aligned, the generated rule provides more detailed categories and slightly broader phrasing, which could lead to minor differences in classification. Overall, they are quite similar in intent and key features, but the generated rule's specificity and phrasing make them not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
