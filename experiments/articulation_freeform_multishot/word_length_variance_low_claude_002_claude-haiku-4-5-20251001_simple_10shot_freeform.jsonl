The generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains at least one common, simple word, and FALSE if it contains only uncommon or sophisticated words. These rules are based on different features: the ground truth focuses on statistical distribution of word lengths, while the generated rule relies on the presence of specific common words. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concepts are not equivalent, as one is length-variance-based and the other is vocabulary-based.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
