The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated rule explicitly lists categories (financial, economic, banking, investment, or money-related concepts) for positive classification and specifies non-financial topics (personal activities, hobbies, leisure, travel) for negative classification. \n\nThey identify similar key features—financial and economic content—and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs. However, the Generated rule is more explicit and detailed about what constitutes positive and negative examples, whereas the Ground Truth is somewhat broader and less specific. This slight difference in phrasing and explicitness accounts for the small gap from perfect equivalence.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are aligned, making them largely equivalent in intent and application.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
