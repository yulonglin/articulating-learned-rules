The Ground Truth rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments. The Generated rule specifies that the input should be classified as True if it discusses finance, economics, investments, banking, money management, or related financial concepts, and False if it discusses personal activities, hobbies, nature, lifestyle, or non-financial topics.  \n\nThey share the core concept of identifying financial or economic content and excluding non-financial topics. The main difference is that the Generated rule explicitly includes \"economics\" and \"money management,\" which are not explicitly mentioned in the Ground Truth but are generally related to finance. Additionally, the Generated rule provides more detailed guidance on what to classify as False, which aligns with the exclusion of non-financial topics.\n\nOverall, they identify the same key features and patterns, and would likely produce similar classifications on most inputs. The slight difference in phrasing and scope results in a high similarity score, but not a perfect 10, because of the added details and slight variation in wording.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
