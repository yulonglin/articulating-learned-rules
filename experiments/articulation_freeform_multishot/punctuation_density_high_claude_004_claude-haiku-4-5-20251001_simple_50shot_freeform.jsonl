It emphasizes a quantitative threshold based on punctuation density. The generated rule, however, centers on qualitative patterns—specifically, the presence of multiple punctuation marks (like ellipses, question marks, or exclamation points) that convey emotional intensity, hesitation, or fragmentation, regardless of their proportion in the text. While both rules involve punctuation, the ground truth is a straightforward percentage cutoff, whereas the generated rule considers the context and pattern of punctuation usage. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., heavily punctuated texts), but they do not necessarily produce the same classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
