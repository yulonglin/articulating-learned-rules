The Ground Truth specifies \"at least one digit that has a letter immediately before and after it,\" which captures any occurrence of a letter-digit-letter sequence anywhere in the text. The Generated Rule explicitly states that the text contains a pattern of a letter, then a digit, then a letter (e.g., \"n3o\"), and classifies accordingly.\n\nThe core concept—detecting a letter-digit-letter pattern—is consistent between the two. However, the Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of at least one such digit with letters on both sides, regardless of other context, while the Generated Rule explicitly looks for the pattern as a contiguous substring.\n\nPotential differences:\n- The Ground Truth might be more flexible, possibly allowing for multiple digits or other characters, as long as one digit is surrounded by letters.\n- The Generated Rule is more specific about the pattern being a contiguous sequence of letter-digit-letter, which aligns with the core concept but is more explicit.\n\nOverall, they are very similar in intent and pattern detection, but the phrasing and emphasis differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
