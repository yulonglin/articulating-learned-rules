The generated rule, however, classifies inputs based on a specific phrase pattern (\"I am\" followed by two long/complex words), which is a very different criterion. While both rules involve word length considerations, the ground truth focuses on overall distribution and variability, whereas the generated rule relies on a particular phrase and word length threshold. They do not identify the same key features or patterns and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concepts—statistical variance versus phrase pattern—are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
