The Generated rule specifies that the input must describe an immediate life-threatening or critical safety emergency requiring urgent action, emphasizing emergency language and danger or injury descriptions. Both rules center on urgency and the need for immediate response, but the Generated rule explicitly includes critical safety emergencies and specifies certain emergency keywords, whereas the Ground Truth is more general about urgent requests or calls for action. They largely overlap in identifying urgent, immediate situations, but the Generated rule is slightly more specific and detailed, which could lead to minor differences in classification. Overall, they share core concepts but differ in scope and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
