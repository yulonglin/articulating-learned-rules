The generated rule, however, specifies that the date must follow the phrase \"Meeting on\" and includes various formats (month name, numeric date, or day/month/year). While both rules focus on detecting dates, the key features differ: the ground truth emphasizes particular date formats anywhere in the input, whereas the generated rule emphasizes a specific phrase preceding the date and a broader set of date formats. They may overlap in some cases but are not fully equivalent, especially since the generated rule restricts detection to a phrase context and broader formats, and the ground truth does not specify context or phrase. Therefore, they are similar but not identical in logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
