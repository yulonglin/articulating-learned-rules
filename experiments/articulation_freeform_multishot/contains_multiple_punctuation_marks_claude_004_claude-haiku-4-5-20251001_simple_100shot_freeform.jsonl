It focuses on counting the number of punctuation marks within the entire input.  \n\nThe generated rule classifies an input as True if it contains at least one word with embedded or attached punctuation marks, and False if all words are clean or only contain common words without special characters. This emphasizes the presence of embedded punctuation within words rather than counting total punctuation marks in the input.  \n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their core concepts differ:  \n- The ground truth counts total punctuation marks across the input.  \n- The generated rule looks for embedded punctuation within words, not necessarily counting total marks.  \n\nThey may produce similar results in some cases (e.g., inputs with multiple punctuation marks or embedded punctuation), but they are not equivalent in logic or pattern detection. The generated rule is more restrictive in focusing on embedded punctuation within words, whereas the ground truth considers the total number of punctuation marks regardless of their placement.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
