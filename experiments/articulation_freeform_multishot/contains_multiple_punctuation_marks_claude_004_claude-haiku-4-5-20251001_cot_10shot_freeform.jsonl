It focuses solely on the count of specific punctuation characters, regardless of their position or context within the text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of punctuation marks (including some additional ones like comma) embedded within or between words, suggesting a focus on punctuation placement and possibly the nature of the text (disrupted or fragmented). It does not specify a count threshold and introduces the idea of punctuation being embedded or interleaved within words, which is a different pattern.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, they differ significantly in their core criteria: one is count-based and specific to certain punctuation marks, the other is pattern-based, emphasizing punctuation placement and context. They may produce similar classifications in some cases (e.g., texts with multiple punctuation marks), but they are not equivalent in logic or focus.\n\nTherefore, the core concepts are only loosely related, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
