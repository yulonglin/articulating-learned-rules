The Ground Truth emphasizes the expression of positive sentiment *specifically about* a product or service, implying a focus on the subject of the sentiment. The Generated Rule broadens this to include satisfaction related to a product, service, or experience, which is similar but slightly more general. They share key features—positive sentiment and a focus on a product or service—and would likely produce similar classifications in most cases. However, the Generated Rule's inclusion of \"experience\" introduces a broader scope, which might lead to some differences in borderline cases. Overall, the core concepts are aligned, making them largely equivalent with minor differences.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
