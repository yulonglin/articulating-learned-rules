The generated rule classifies statements based on their level of abstraction or specificity—whether they are general/conceptual or personal/specific. While there is some overlap—since general/conceptual statements often relate to broad topics—the core features differ: one is content-based, the other is form-based. They would not necessarily produce the same classifications for all inputs; for example, a specific personal story about investing in a bank might be classified differently under the two rules. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, nor are their core concepts equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
