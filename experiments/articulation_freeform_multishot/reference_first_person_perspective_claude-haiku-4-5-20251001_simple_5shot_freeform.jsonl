The Generated Rule, however, classifies based on whether the input describes a personal struggle or challenge affecting the speaker's life, without explicitly requiring first-person language. While both rules aim to identify personal difficulties, the Ground Truth emphasizes perspective markers, whereas the Generated Rule centers on the content of the description (personal struggle vs. neutral observation). As a result, they may overlap in many cases but can diverge—e.g., a personal challenge described without first-person pronouns might be classified differently. Therefore, they share some core concepts but are not perfectly aligned in features or classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
