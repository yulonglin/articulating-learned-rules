This focuses on the property of individual words being palindromes.\n\nThe generated rule, however, is based on the presence of specific words (\"sat\", \"level\", \"input\", \"kayak\", \"radar\") and their combinations—requiring at least two of these words or the presence of \"kayak\" or \"radar\" with any other qualifying word. It does not consider whether these words are palindromes; for example, \"sat\" and \"input\" are not palindromes, but are included in the set.\n\nTherefore, the generated rule does not capture the core concept of the ground truth rule (palindromic words). It introduces a different pattern based on specific words and their counts, which may lead to different classifications, especially in cases where the text contains palindromes not in the set or contains the set words that are not palindromes.\n\nWhile there is some overlap—since \"level\", \"kayak\", and \"radar\" are palindromes—the overall logic differs significantly. The core concept of identifying palindromic words is not equivalent to counting specific words or their combinations.\n\nHence, the two rules are only partially aligned and do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6739130434782609,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":46,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":4,"accuracy":0.6739130434782609},"parse_error":false}
