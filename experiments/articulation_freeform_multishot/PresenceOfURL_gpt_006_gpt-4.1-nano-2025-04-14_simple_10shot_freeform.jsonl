The Ground Truth rule considers URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', which could include 'http', 'https', and any URL beginning with 'www'. The Generated rule explicitly mentions URLs starting with \"http://\" or \"https://\", and also includes the word \"www\" anywhere in the input. \n\nThey identify similar key features—presence of URL patterns and \"www\"—but the phrasing and scope differ slightly. The Ground Truth focuses on patterns starting with 'http' or 'www', potentially missing URLs with other schemes or formats, while the Generated rule explicitly specifies \"http://\" or \"https://\", which are common URL schemes, and includes \"www\" as a keyword regardless of position.\n\nMost inputs containing URLs with these patterns would be classified similarly, but edge cases (e.g., URLs with different schemes or formats) might lead to different classifications. Therefore, they are largely aligned conceptually but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
