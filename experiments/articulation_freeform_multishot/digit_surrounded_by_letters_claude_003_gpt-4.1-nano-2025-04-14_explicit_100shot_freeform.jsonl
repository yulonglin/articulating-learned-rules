The generated rule states that a text is classified as True if it contains at least one lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit, with no mention of what follows the digit.\n\nWhile both rules involve digits and lowercase letters, they differ in key aspects:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes a digit sandwiched between two letters, requiring both a preceding and following letter.  \n- The generated rule only requires a lowercase letter immediately before a digit, with no condition on what comes after the digit.\n\nIn many cases, texts matching the ground truth pattern (e.g., 'a5b') will also satisfy the generated rule (since 'a5' has a lowercase letter followed by a digit). However, the generated rule can classify texts as True even if the digit is not flanked by letters on both sides (e.g., 'a5' or '3b'), which the ground truth would not.\n\nTherefore, they are similar but not identical in pattern detection, leading to a reasonably high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
