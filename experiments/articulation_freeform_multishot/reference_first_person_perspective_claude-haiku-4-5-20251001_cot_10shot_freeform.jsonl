The Generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of emotional or internal states versus external factual descriptions, without explicit reference to perspective or pronoun usage. While there is some overlap—personal emotional experiences often involve first-person language—the core features differ: one emphasizes perspective (first-person), the other emphasizes emotional/internal content regardless of perspective. As a result, they would produce similar classifications in some cases but diverge in others, especially when personal perspective is absent but internal states are expressed, or vice versa.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
