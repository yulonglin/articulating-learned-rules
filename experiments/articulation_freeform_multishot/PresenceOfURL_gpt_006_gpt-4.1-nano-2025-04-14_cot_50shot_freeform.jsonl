The Ground Truth specifies URLs starting with \"http\" or \"www\", while the Generated rule broadens this to include URLs starting with \"http://\", \"https://\", or \"www.\"—which are essentially the same patterns with slight variations in phrasing. They would generally produce the same classifications on most inputs containing such URLs. However, the slight difference in phrasing (\"starting with 'http'\" or \"www'\" vs. \"starting with 'http://', 'https://', or 'www.'\") introduces a minor discrepancy: the Ground Truth does not explicitly mention \"https://\" or the trailing period after \"www.\", which could lead to different classifications in edge cases. Overall, the core concept—presence of a URL pattern—is aligned, making them highly similar but not perfectly identical.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
