The generated rule classifies texts as TRUE based on the presence of multiple consecutive exclamation or question marks, emphasizing specific punctuation patterns associated with emotion or emphasis. While both involve punctuation, they target different features: one measures overall punctuation proportion, the other looks for particular punctuation sequences. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially texts with high punctuation density but no consecutive marks, or texts with multiple consecutive marks but low overall punctuation percentage. The core concepts—punctuation density versus specific punctuation patterns—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
