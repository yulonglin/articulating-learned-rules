The generated rule, however, classifies based on the ratio of non-English/gibberish words to recognizable English words, which is a semantic and language-based criterion. These rules do not identify the same features or patterns; one is about word length sequences, the other about language recognition. They would rarely produce the same classification on the same input, as they rely on fundamentally different aspects of the text. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their classifications are unlikely to align consistently.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
