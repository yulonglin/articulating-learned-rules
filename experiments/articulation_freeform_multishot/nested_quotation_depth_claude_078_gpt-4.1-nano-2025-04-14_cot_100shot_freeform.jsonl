The generated rule, however, centers on detecting whether the sentence contains a quotation referencing hearing or stating \"Yes\" or \"Never\" within speech attribution contexts, focusing on the content of the quotation and its semantic meaning rather than the nesting structure. While both rules involve quotations, their key features differ: one emphasizes nesting depth, the other emphasizes the presence of specific content related to affirmations or negations within speech attributions. They may overlap in some cases but are not equivalent in scope or focus, leading to different classifications in many instances.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
