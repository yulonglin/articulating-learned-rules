The generated rule, however, considers repeated characters (like \"!!!\" or \"....\") but also includes specific keywords (\"code,\" \"run,\" \"test\") and relies on the presence of action-oriented language or markers of executable/test content. It also mentions generic words like \"function\" or \"sample\" as negative indicators, which are not part of the ground truth rule. \n\nWhile both rules recognize repeated characters as a feature, the generated rule introduces additional criteria unrelated to punctuation sequences, making their core patterns different. They would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs, especially when considering the broader set of features in the generated rule. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and the rules are only loosely related at best.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
