The generated rule adds an additional constraint that the palindrome must be at least 5 letters long. While both rules focus on the presence of a palindrome word, the generated rule narrows the criteria, potentially excluding shorter palindromes (e.g., \"madam\" vs. \"dad\"). Therefore, they share the core concept of identifying palindromic words but differ in the specific pattern (length constraint). This means they will often produce similar results but can diverge when shorter palindromes are present. Overall, they are related but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
