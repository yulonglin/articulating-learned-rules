This captures a broad range of repetitive or highly predictable texts, regardless of specific words or length.\n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses on explicit patterns such as repeated words, sounds, or very short exclamations, and explicitly excludes longer, varied phrases like proverbs. While there is some overlap—both rules tend to classify very repetitive or simple texts as TRUE—the generated rule is more specific in identifying particular types of repetition and short utterances, and it explicitly excludes more complex, varied texts.\n\nThey share the core concept of identifying simple, predictable, or repetitive content, but the generated rule is narrower and more prescriptive, whereas the ground truth rule is based on a quantitative measure (entropy) that can encompass a wider range of patterns. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in scope or approach.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
