The Generated rule broadens this by including descriptions of tangible, personal benefits or improvements (e.g., helping, improving, boosting confidence), often with positive sentiment, but also emphasizes the presence of benefits or improvements rather than explicitly requiring positive sentiment about the product or service itself.  \n\nWhile both rules aim to identify positive evaluations related to products, services, or experiences, the generated rule introduces additional criteria (benefits, improvements, specific actions) that are not explicitly present in the ground truth. This could lead to differences in classification, especially in cases where a text is positive but does not mention tangible benefits or improvements, or vice versa.  \n\nOverall, they share some core concepts—positive evaluation of a product/service/experience—but differ in scope and emphasis, making them only partially aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
