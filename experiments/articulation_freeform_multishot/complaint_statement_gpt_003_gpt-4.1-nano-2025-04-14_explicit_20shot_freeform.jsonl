The Ground Truth explicitly states that the text must mention dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit expressions of negative evaluation. The Generated Rule broadly captures this by classifying texts as True if they describe negative experiences, problems, or inconveniences, which aligns with expressions of dissatisfaction. While the phrasing differs—one emphasizes explicit statements, the other includes problems and inconveniences—the core concept of identifying negative or critical content is consistent. The slight difference is that the generated rule may include texts describing problems or inconveniences that are not necessarily expressed as dissatisfaction or criticism, potentially leading to minor classification discrepancies. Overall, the core features and patterns are similar, making them largely equivalent in intent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
