The generated rule, however, specifies that True cases are those where at least one word contains an exclamation mark, implying the exclamation mark is embedded within a word. This subtle difference means that the ground truth could classify inputs with multiple standalone exclamation marks (e.g., \"Wow!!\") as True, whereas the generated rule might not, if those exclamation marks are not within words. Conversely, the generated rule might classify inputs with a single word containing an exclamation mark as True, even if the total number of exclamation marks is less than two, which would not match the ground truth. Therefore, while both rules focus on the presence of exclamation marks, their criteria differ in terms of quantity and context, leading to potential discrepancies in classification.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
