The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if all alphabetic characters are uppercase and there is at least one letter. The Generated Rule states that all words must be in uppercase for True, and any lowercase word results in False. These are effectively equivalent conditions, as both enforce that every alphabetic component must be uppercase and that at least one letter exists. The main difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes individual alphabetic characters, while the Generated Rule focuses on words. However, since words are composed of alphabetic characters, the core pattern—uppercase letters throughout—is the same. Therefore, they identify the same key features and would produce identical classifications on most inputs, making them nearly equivalent in logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
