The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, and checks for reading the same forwards and backwards. The generated rule adds punctuation to the list of characters to ignore, which is a slight extension, but the core concept remains the same: the classification depends on whether the cleaned text is a palindrome. The only difference is that the generated rule explicitly mentions ignoring punctuation, which the ground truth does not specify, but this does not fundamentally change the core logic. Therefore, they are nearly equivalent in intent and behavior, with a very minor difference in the scope of ignored characters.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
