In contrast, the generated rule centers on detecting repeated words that appear in different cases (e.g., 'jumps' and 'JuMpS'), focusing on case variation across multiple instances of the same word. While both involve case patterns, the first is about internal letter casing within a single word, and the second is about case differences across repeated words. They do not identify the same features or patterns and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5510204081632653,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":27,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.5510204081632653},"parse_error":false}
