The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which centers on urgency and the need for prompt response. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"urgent call for help, emergency situations, or immediate action requests related to safety or health,\" adding specific contexts (help, emergency, safety, health) and framing the message as containing these elements. While the core concept of urgency and immediate action is shared, the Generated Rule introduces additional context and scope, making it slightly more inclusive. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
