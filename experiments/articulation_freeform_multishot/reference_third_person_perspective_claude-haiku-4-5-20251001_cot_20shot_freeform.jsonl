The Generated Rule focuses on the content of the actions or behaviors—whether they involve human decision-making, emotions, or skills versus scenes, sensory details, or objects—without explicitly mentioning perspective or narrative voice. While both rules aim to distinguish between human-centered actions and more atmospheric or scene-based descriptions, they do so based on different key features. The Ground Truth centers on perspective and agency, whereas the Generated Rule centers on the nature of the content (behavioral vs. descriptive). They overlap in intent but differ in the specific features they prioritize, leading to partial but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
