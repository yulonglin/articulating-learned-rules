The generated rule, however, classifies texts based solely on the presence of at least one word containing any digit, regardless of surrounding characters or position. While both rules involve digits, the ground truth emphasizes a specific contextual pattern (digits flanked by letters), whereas the generated rule is more permissive, requiring only the presence of a digit within a word. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications may differ on many inputs, especially those with digits not surrounded by letters. The core concept of involving digits is shared, but the pattern specificity differs significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
