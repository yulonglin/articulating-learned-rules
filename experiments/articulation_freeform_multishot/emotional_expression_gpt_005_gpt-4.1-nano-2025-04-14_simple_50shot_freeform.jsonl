The Generated rule broadens this to include positive or intense emotional experiences like love and also considers the intensity (\"intense\") of emotions, while explicitly excluding neutral or passive observations. Although both rules aim to identify emotional content, the Generated rule introduces additional emotional states (e.g., love), emphasizes intensity, and explicitly excludes neutral descriptions, which may lead to different classifications in some cases. Therefore, they share some core concepts but differ significantly in scope and criteria, resulting in partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
