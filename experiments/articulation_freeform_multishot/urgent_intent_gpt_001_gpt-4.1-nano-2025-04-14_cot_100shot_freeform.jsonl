In contrast, False examples lack such urgency or emergency context and are more casual, informational, or polite statements without immediate threat implications. \n\nRule:  \nA message is classified as True if it explicitly indicates an urgent emergency situation requiring immediate action or response, often using keywords like \"urgent,\" \"emergency,\" \"immediate,\" \"evacuate,\" or similar language signaling a critical or life-threatening scenario; otherwise, it is False.","keyword_match_score":0.6666666666666666,"rouge_l_score":0.19230769230769232,"llm_judge_score":0.7,"llm_judge_reasoning":"Both rules aim to identify messages that indicate urgent or immediate action. The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, focusing on the intent or nature of the message. The Generated Rule specifies that the message must explicitly indicate an emergency situation requiring immediate response, often using specific keywords like \"urgent,\" \"emergency,\" \"immediate,\" or \"evacuate,\" and signals a critical or life-threatening scenario.\n\nThey share the core concept of urgency and immediate action, but the Generated Rule introduces a more explicit keyword-based criterion and emphasizes emergency scenarios, which may not be explicitly required in the Ground Truth. Conversely, the Ground Truth could include messages implying urgency without explicit keywords, whereas the Generated Rule relies on explicit language and keywords.\n\nOverall, they are similar in intent and core concept but differ slightly in the criteria and specificity, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
