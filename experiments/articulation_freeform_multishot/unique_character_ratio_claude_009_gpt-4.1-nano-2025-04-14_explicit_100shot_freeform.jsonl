In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE only if they contain a specific pattern: at least one sequence of four identical characters in a row. These are fundamentally different criteria: the first assesses overall character variety, while the second looks for a particular repeated pattern. They may sometimes overlap (e.g., a text with many repeated characters might also contain such sequences), but they do not identify the same features or patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
