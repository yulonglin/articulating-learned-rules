The Ground Truth rule explicitly mentions these topics, while the Generated rule broadens the scope to include financial concepts and literacy, and explicitly excludes travel, leisure, or non-financial activities. They identify similar key features—financial content—but the Generated rule introduces additional concepts like literacy and explicitly states what to exclude, which slightly broadens or clarifies the classification criteria. Overall, they largely overlap in identifying financial discussions, but the phrasing and scope differences prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
