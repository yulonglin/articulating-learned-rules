It focuses solely on counting punctuation marks in the entire text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies an input as True only if there is at least one word with internal punctuation (punctuation embedded within the word), and False otherwise. It emphasizes the internal placement of punctuation within words, not the total number of punctuation marks.\n\nThese rules differ significantly in their key features:  \n- The ground truth considers the total count of punctuation marks, regardless of their position or whether they are within words or at the end.  \n- The generated rule considers the internal placement of punctuation within individual words, not the total count.\n\nThey would produce similar classifications only in very limited cases where the presence of multiple punctuation marks coincides with internal punctuation within words, but generally, they are not aligned. The core concepts—count-based vs. position-based internal punctuation—are different.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their equivalence is minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
