This focuses on the entire set of letters and their arrangements, i.e., anagrammatic relationships.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies words based solely on the presence of the letters \"e,\" \"n,\" and \"s\" anywhere in the word, regardless of their arrangement or whether the word is an anagram of the specified words. While \"listen\" contains \"e,\" \"n,\" and \"s,\" so it is classified as True, many words containing these letters are not anagrams of the target words. Conversely, some anagrams of \"listen\" (like \"silent\") would be classified as True, but words like \"below\" or \"study\" are not necessarily identified by this rule.\n\nOverall, the core concept of the ground truth involves exact anagram matching, whereas the generated rule relies on a subset of letters, leading to different classification patterns. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their outputs would differ on many inputs.\n\nTherefore, the two rules are only loosely related and do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
