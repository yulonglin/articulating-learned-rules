It does not consider the emotional or expressive context of the punctuation, nor does it specify particular types of punctuation or accompanying words.\n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses on the presence of expressive punctuation (e.g., multiple exclamation points, question marks, ellipses) combined with words or phrases that convey strong emotion, surprise, or disbelief. It emphasizes qualitative aspects—emotional emphasis and context—rather than just the quantity of punctuation.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation and emotional expression, the ground truth rule is purely quantitative and does not account for the nature or intent behind punctuation, whereas the generated rule is qualitative and context-dependent. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., heavily punctuated texts with emotional content), but they are not equivalent in scope or criteria.\n\nTherefore, they describe related but not identical classification logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
