The generated rule, however, centers on the presence of specific identifiable numbers (like account or tracking numbers) and distinguishes these from general quantities or vague temporal references. While both rules involve numerical content, the ground truth emphasizes a ratio-based pattern, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of particular types of identifiable numbers. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classification criteria are quite different. Therefore, they are only loosely related and do not produce the same classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
