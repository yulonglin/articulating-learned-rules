The ground truth specifies that the input is True if any character appears two or more times consecutively, focusing on immediate adjacency. The generated rule suggests that True cases include words with repeated letters anywhere in the word, not necessarily consecutive, and also mentions specific words like \"success,\" \"hello,\" and \"book\" that contain repeated letters. While the generated rule broadens the pattern to include non-consecutive repetitions, the core concept—presence of repeated characters—is similar. They would largely agree on most inputs, especially those with consecutive repeats. However, the generated rule might classify some words with non-consecutive repeated letters as True, which the ground truth does not. Therefore, they are closely aligned in concept but not perfectly equivalent in pattern specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
