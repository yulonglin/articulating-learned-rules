The generated rule specifies that the input must be an anagram of \"silent,\" which is a specific word. While both rules involve identifying anagrams, the ground truth encompasses multiple different words, whereas the generated rule focuses solely on one word (\"silent\"). They share the core concept of detecting anagrams, but the scope and key features differ: the ground truth is broader, involving multiple target words, while the generated rule is narrowly focused on one. Therefore, they do not produce identical classifications across all inputs, and their core concepts are similar but not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
