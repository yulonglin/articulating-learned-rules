In contrast, the generated rule classifies based on the frequency of specific words, specifically whether any word appears three or more times. These are fundamentally different features: one examines the distribution of word lengths, the other examines word repetition frequency. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could have consistent word lengths but no repeated words, or vice versa. The core concepts—word length variance versus word repetition—are not equivalent, making the rules largely unrelated in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
