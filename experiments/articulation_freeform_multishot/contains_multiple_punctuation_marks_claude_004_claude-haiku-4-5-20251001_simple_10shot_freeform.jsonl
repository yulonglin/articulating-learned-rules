The generated rule, however, requires the presence of at least one special character from a similar set *and* at least one keyword from a predefined set, making it a conjunction of two conditions. Additionally, the generated rule's threshold is at least one punctuation mark and one keyword, which is a much less strict criterion than the ground truth's requirement of three or more punctuation marks. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ significantly on many inputs. The core concept of counting punctuation is only loosely related to the combined condition involving keywords, so they are not equivalent in logic or intent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
