The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's focus on conveying urgent, emergency, or critical situations. Both mention key indicators such as words like \"urgent,\" \"immediate,\" \"critical,\" and situations involving safety or hazards. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly includes a broader set of key indicators and situational contexts (e.g., medical crises, hazards, time-sensitive demands) and clarifies what constitutes false examples (routine requests, questions, non-emergency). The Ground Truth is slightly more concise and less detailed about specific indicators or the scope of situations.\n\nOverall, the core concept—identifying texts that call for immediate action in urgent or emergency contexts—is consistent. The main difference is the level of detail and explicitness in the features considered. This results in a high degree of overlap, but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
