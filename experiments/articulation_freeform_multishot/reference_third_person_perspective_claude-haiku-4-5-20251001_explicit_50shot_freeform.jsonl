The Ground Truth emphasizes third-person perspective and human involvement, while the Generated rule focuses on identifying actions, preferences, emotions, abilities, and decisions as indicators of human agency. Although phrased differently, they largely target similar patterns—actions and states involving humans versus descriptive or natural phenomena. However, the Ground Truth explicitly mentions perspective and pronouns, which the Generated rule does not, and the Generated rule provides a more structured set of indicators. These differences account for the slight divergence, but overall, they describe very similar classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
