The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit mention of negative feelings or evaluations. The Generated Rule broadens this to include descriptions of negative experiences, complaints, problems, or dissatisfaction, and explicitly states the opposite for positive expressions. While the phrasing differs—one emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction, the other includes a broader range of negative descriptors—the core concept of identifying negative sentiment or criticism is essentially the same. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"problem\" and \"complaint,\" which may slightly expand the scope, but overall, they align closely in identifying negative versus positive evaluations.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
