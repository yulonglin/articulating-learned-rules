In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on a specific phrase pattern (\"I am\" followed by two words each at least 10 characters long). These criteria are fundamentally different: one is a statistical measure of word length variability, the other is a syntactic pattern involving specific words and length constraints. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classification on the same input. The core concepts—statistical variance versus phrase pattern—are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
