The Generated Rule, on the other hand, classifies based on the presence of escaped quotes (`\\\"`) indicating nested quotations, and distinguishes between single-level quotes and nested quotes, associating nested quotes with reported speech.\n\nWhile both rules focus on nested quotations, the Ground Truth emphasizes the structural depth (at least 2 levels), whereas the Generated Rule relies on the presence of escaped quotes as a proxy for nesting. They are aligned in identifying nested quotations as a key feature, but the Ground Truth explicitly requires a minimum nesting depth, while the Generated Rule interprets escaped quotes as indicative of nesting, which may or may not correspond to actual nesting depth.\n\nTherefore, they share a core concept—nested quotations—but differ in the specific criteria and how nesting is detected. They would often produce similar classifications when nesting is clear and properly formatted, but could diverge in edge cases (e.g., unescaped nested quotes, different formatting). Overall, they are related but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
