This focuses on the statistical dispersion of word lengths within the text, regardless of specific word content or patterns.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies texts as TRUE when there are at least two consecutive long or complex words (6+ letters or sophisticated vocabulary), emphasizing the presence of specific word patterns or sequences rather than overall length variability. It also considers the absence of such patterns as a reason for FALSE classification.\n\nWhile both rules relate to word length and complexity, they target different aspects: the ground truth emphasizes overall length variability, whereas the generated rule emphasizes local patterns of consecutive complex words. They may sometimes align—texts with highly variable word lengths might also contain consecutive long words—but generally, they are based on different features and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs.\n\nTherefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
