It focuses solely on the count and presence of certain punctuation characters.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of \"special characters\" embedded within words, and distinguishes between embedded punctuation and punctuation only at the end of words. It also introduces the idea that only \"clean words\" with punctuation at the end or no punctuation lead to a False classification. This description adds a layer of complexity and a different focus—on the placement of punctuation within words—rather than just counting punctuation marks.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, the ground truth is purely quantitative and positional (counting total punctuation marks), whereas the generated rule emphasizes the context of punctuation placement within words and the presence of embedded characters. They do not necessarily identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications could differ on many inputs, especially those with embedded punctuation but fewer than three total punctuation marks.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent in core logic, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
