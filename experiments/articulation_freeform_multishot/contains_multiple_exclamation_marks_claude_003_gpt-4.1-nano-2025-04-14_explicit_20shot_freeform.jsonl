The generated rule, however, specifies that a text is True only if it contains at least one exclamation mark that is immediately adjacent to an alphabetic character, which is a more restrictive condition. This means the generated rule excludes cases where exclamation marks are present but not next to alphabetic characters, even if there are two or more exclamation marks overall. Therefore, while both rules involve exclamation marks, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ in many cases. The core concept of counting exclamation marks differs from the adjacency condition, making the core logic only partially overlapping.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
