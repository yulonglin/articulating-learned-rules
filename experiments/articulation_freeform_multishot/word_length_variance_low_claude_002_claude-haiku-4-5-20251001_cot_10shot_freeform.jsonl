The generated rule, however, focuses on lexical simplicity—specifically, the presence of simple, concrete words and the avoidance of certain phrase patterns (like starting with \"a an\" or containing abstract vocabulary). These are fundamentally different features: one is quantitative (variance of word lengths), the other qualitative (word familiarity and phrase structure). While both aim to distinguish certain types of text, they do not identify the same key patterns or features. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially since a text could have low variance in word length but contain complex vocabulary, or vice versa. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their classification logic differs significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
