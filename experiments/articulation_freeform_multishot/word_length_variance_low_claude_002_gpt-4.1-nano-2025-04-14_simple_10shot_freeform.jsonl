The generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of repeated words, regardless of length or distribution. These are fundamentally different features: one focuses on the distribution of word lengths, the other on word repetition. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could have uniform word lengths without repeated words, or contain repeated words with highly variable word lengths. The core concepts—word length variance versus repeated words—are not equivalent, making the rules largely unrelated in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
