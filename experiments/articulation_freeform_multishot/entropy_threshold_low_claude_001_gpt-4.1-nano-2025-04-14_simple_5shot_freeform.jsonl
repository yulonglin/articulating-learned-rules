In contrast, the generated rule relies solely on the presence of the word \"test,\" a specific keyword, which is a much narrower and more explicit pattern. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; the entropy-based rule considers the entire character distribution, while the keyword rule focuses on a particular word. They would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially if texts are not containing \"test\" but are still predictable or repetitive, or vice versa. The core concepts are different: one measures overall character predictability, the other searches for a specific word. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic or behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
