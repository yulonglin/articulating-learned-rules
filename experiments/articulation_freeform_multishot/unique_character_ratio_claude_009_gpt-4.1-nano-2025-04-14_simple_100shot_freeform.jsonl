The generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains a repeated sequence of a single word or character appearing at least four times, emphasizing pattern repetition at the word or character level.\n\nWhile both rules focus on repetition, they differ in scope and nature:  \n- The ground truth rule is based on overall character diversity, capturing texts with high repetition or limited variety, regardless of specific patterns.  \n- The generated rule targets explicit repeated sequences, specifically a single word or character repeated at least four times, forming a pattern.\n\nThey may overlap in cases where high repetition leads to low character variety, but they are not equivalent. The ground truth could classify texts with many repeated characters but no repeated word pattern as TRUE, whereas the generated rule would not. Conversely, the generated rule might classify texts with repeated words but diverse characters overall as TRUE, which the ground truth rule might not.\n\nOverall, they share a conceptual focus on repetition but differ significantly in the specific features they identify and the patterns they consider.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
