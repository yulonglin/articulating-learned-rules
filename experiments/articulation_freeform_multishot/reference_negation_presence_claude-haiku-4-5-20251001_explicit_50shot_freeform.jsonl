The generated rule attempts to find a pattern that distinguishes True from False classifications, but it is somewhat vague, referring to \"patterns that distinguish True from False\" without explicitly mentioning negation words.  \n\nHowever, based on the analysis of examples, the key feature for the ground truth rule is the presence of negation words, which the generated rule seems to implicitly target by seeking distinguishing patterns. The main difference is that the generated rule is less explicit and more abstract, potentially capturing other patterns beyond negation words, but in practice, the core concept—negation words indicating negative classification—is effectively the same.  \n\nTherefore, the generated rule aligns closely with the ground truth rule's intent, with only minor differences in phrasing and explicitness, leading to a high similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
