The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the generated rule extends this to ignore punctuation as well. Since the core concept—checking for a palindrome—is the same, and both focus on ignoring case and spaces, they are very similar. The main difference is that the generated rule includes punctuation in the ignoring process, which makes it slightly more comprehensive. Therefore, they would produce identical classifications on most inputs, especially those without punctuation, and are essentially equivalent in their core logic. The slight difference in handling punctuation accounts for a near-perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
