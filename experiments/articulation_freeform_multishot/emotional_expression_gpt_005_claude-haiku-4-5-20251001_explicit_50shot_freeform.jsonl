The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the emotional content itself. The Generated Rule broadens this to include any \"emotion, feeling, or emotional state\" experienced by the narrator or subject, which aligns closely with the Ground Truth's focus but is slightly more inclusive in wording.\n\nBoth rules identify emotional content as the key feature, and they would largely produce similar classifications. However, the Ground Truth specifies \"a clear emotional state,\" which might imply a more explicit or overt expression, whereas the Generated Rule encompasses any emotional experience, potentially including subtler or implied feelings. Additionally, the Generated Rule explicitly excludes descriptions of physical actions or environmental details, aligning with the Ground Truth's focus on emotional states rather than descriptive content.\n\nOverall, the core concept—distinguishing emotional expressions from non-emotional descriptions—is the same, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
