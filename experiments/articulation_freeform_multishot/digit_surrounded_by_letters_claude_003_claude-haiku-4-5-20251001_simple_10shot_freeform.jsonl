The generated rule, however, relies on the presence of at least two specific words from a set and a particular 3-character alphanumeric code at the end, or alternatively, a simple sentence about a year without those keywords and code. These criteria are quite different: the ground truth centers on a pattern involving digits and letters, while the generated rule emphasizes keyword presence and a code suffix, with an exception for year-related sentences. They do not identify the same key features or patterns and would rarely produce the same classifications on the same inputs.
