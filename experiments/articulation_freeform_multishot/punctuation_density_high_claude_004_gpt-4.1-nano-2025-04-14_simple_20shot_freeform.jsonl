In contrast, the generated rule centers on the presence of multiple exclamation points or interjections to indicate excitement or emphasis, especially when combined with question marks or ellipses. These are different key features: one measures overall punctuation density, the other looks for specific expressive punctuation patterns. While both involve punctuation, they target different aspects and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs. The core concepts are not equivalent, and the rules do not identify the same patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
