It does not specify the nature of the repetition—only the overall character variety.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses specifically on repeated words or character sequences with consistent spacing, implying a pattern of exact repetition at the word or character level. While both rules relate to repetition, the ground truth rule is broader, capturing any low-diversity text, whereas the generated rule emphasizes structured, repeated sequences.  \n\nThey may produce similar classifications in cases of highly repetitive text (e.g., repeated characters or words), but they can diverge when the text has low character variety but no exact repetition pattern, or when repetition is irregular.
