The Ground Truth emphasizes the use of first-person pronouns and perspective (\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" \"we,\" \"us\") as a key feature, focusing on the perspective of the statement. The Generated Rule centers on the presence of personal feelings, emotions, or internal states, regardless of pronoun usage, and explicitly distinguishes subjective internal states from external facts or observations. \n\nWhile there is a strong overlap—both rules target internal emotional content—the Ground Truth's focus on first-person perspective may include some subjective statements that do not explicitly express internal feelings, and vice versa. Conversely, the Generated Rule might classify some statements as true based on emotional content even if they are not strictly first-person, which could differ from the Ground Truth's perspective-based approach.\n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying internal emotional states versus external facts, but differ slightly in the emphasis on perspective versus content. Therefore, they are quite similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
