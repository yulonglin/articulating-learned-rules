This means that the generated rule classifies inputs with exactly one exclamation mark as True, which the ground truth rule would classify as False. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns and would produce different classifications in cases where there is exactly one exclamation mark. They share the core concept of using exclamation marks but differ in the threshold, leading to only partial overlap in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
