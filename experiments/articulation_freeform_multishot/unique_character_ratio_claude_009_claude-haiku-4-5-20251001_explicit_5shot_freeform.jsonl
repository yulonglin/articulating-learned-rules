It does not specify the pattern or structure of the text, only the overall character diversity.\n\nThe generated rule, however, describes a very specific pattern: text composed of repeated single-letter groups separated by spaces, such as \"X X X\" or \"XX XX X.\" It explicitly excludes actual words, punctuation, or multiple different letters, focusing on a particular repetitive pattern.\n\nWhile both rules tend to identify texts with limited character variety, the ground truth rule is broader and more flexible, capturing any text with low character diversity regardless of pattern, including random repetitions, strings of the same character, or even some patterned texts. The generated rule is more restrictive, requiring a specific pattern of repeated single-letter groups separated by spaces.\n\nTherefore, they do not identify exactly the same set of texts, and their classification logic differs significantly. They share some conceptual similarity in targeting low character diversity but differ in pattern specificity and scope.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are related but not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
