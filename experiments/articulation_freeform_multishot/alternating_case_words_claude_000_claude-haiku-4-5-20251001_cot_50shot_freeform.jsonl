The Ground Truth specifies \"letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase,\" which suggests a pattern like 'aBcDeF' where each subsequent letter switches case, implying a strict alternating pattern within a single word. The Generated Rule states \"mixed case (containing both uppercase and lowercase letters),\" which is a broader criterion that includes any word with at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter, regardless of order or pattern. \n\nThey share the core concept of detecting words with both uppercase and lowercase letters, but the Ground Truth's emphasis on an alternating pattern is more specific than the broader \"mixed case\" criterion. As a result, they would produce identical classifications on many inputs—particularly those with words that have a clear alternating pattern—but could differ on words that contain both cases but do not follow an alternating sequence.\n\nOverall, the core concept is similar, but the specificity differs slightly, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
