The generated rule, however, classifies texts as positive if they contain at least four words or end with certain punctuation marks, which is a much broader and less specific condition. It does not consider the presence of repeated punctuation sequences, nor does it focus on punctuation patterns. Therefore, the two rules do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classifications on the same inputs. The core concepts—punctuation pattern versus word count and ending punctuation—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
