The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on \"immediate, life-threatening, or safety-critical emergency\" situations. Both rules recognize that non-emergency communications (routine, social, scheduling, reminders) are to be classified as false. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly includes examples like medical emergencies, evacuations, hazardous situations, security threats, and critical infrastructure failures, which broadens the scope slightly beyond the more general \"urgent request or call for immediate action\" in the Ground Truth. The phrasing differs—one emphasizes the nature of the request, the other emphasizes the severity and criticality—but the core concept of urgency and immediate response is consistent.\n\nThe main difference is that the Ground Truth may be slightly narrower in scope, focusing on requests or calls, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly includes various types of emergencies and critical situations, potentially capturing a broader set of urgent texts. Despite this, the core logic and intent are very similar.\n\nTherefore, the two rules are largely aligned in identifying urgent, action-requiring situations, with minor differences in scope and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
