The Ground Truth specifies that the text indicates an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's emphasis on explicitly mentioning emergency, urgent situation, or immediate need for assistance or action. The generated rule also broadens the scope slightly to include mentions of hazards, threats, or critical incidents, which are consistent with the core concept of urgency and immediacy.  \n\nHowever, the generated rule explicitly states the types of situations (medical emergencies, hazards, threats, critical incidents), which may introduce some differences in interpretation compared to the more general phrasing of the ground truth. Despite this, the core concepts—urgent, immediate action, emergency—are well aligned, making the rules largely equivalent in intent and likely to produce similar classifications. The slight difference in phrasing and scope accounts for the score not being a perfect 10.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
