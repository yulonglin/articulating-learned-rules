The generated rule classifies words based solely on the presence of the letters 'e' or 'i', regardless of their position or the word's overall structure. These rules do not identify the same features: the ground truth focuses on anagrammatic relationships, while the generated rule focuses on specific letter presence. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, as many words containing 'e' or 'i' may not be anagrams of the specified words, and vice versa. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or pattern recognition.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
