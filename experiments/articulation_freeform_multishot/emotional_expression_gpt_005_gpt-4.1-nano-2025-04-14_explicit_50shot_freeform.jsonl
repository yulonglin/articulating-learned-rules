The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the explicit expression of emotions. The Generated Rule broadens this to include positive or intense emotional experiences or sensations, explicitly listing happiness, excitement, love, pride, or despair, and contrasts these with neutral or mundane descriptions or physical observations.  \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying emotional expressions as key features. However, the Generated Rule introduces additional emotional states (love, pride, despair) and emphasizes intensity, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly specify. Conversely, the Ground Truth is slightly more general, not listing specific emotions but emphasizing the presence of any clear emotional state.  \n\nMost inputs expressing the core emotions listed would be classified similarly by both rules, but the Generated Rule's inclusion of additional emotions and the emphasis on intensity could lead to some differences in borderline cases. Overall, they describe similar classification logic with some differences in scope and phrasing.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
