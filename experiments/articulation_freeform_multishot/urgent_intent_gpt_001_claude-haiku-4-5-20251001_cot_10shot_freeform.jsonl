There's a spill of hazardous waste—evacuate immediately.\" - Dangerous hazard requiring evacuation\n- \"Call for immediate medical aid—patient is critical.\" - Critical medical emergency\n- \"Urgent request: evacuate due to chemical hazard.\" - Imminent danger requiring evacuation\n\n**False cases:**\n- \"Please confirm your attendance at the event.\" - Administrative request\n- \"Keep up the good work!\" - Encouragement/praise\n- \"Have a wonderful holiday season.\" - Greeting/well-wishes\n- \"Thanks for your patience.\" - Gratitude\n- \"Can you help me with this task?\" - General assistance request\n\n**Pattern:** True cases involve **immediate life-threatening or safety-critical situations** that require urgent emergency response (medical emergencies, physical danger, hazardous conditions).

The Ground Truth emphasizes an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the immediacy and urgency. The Generated Rule specifies an \"immediate emergency situation involving imminent danger to life, health, or safety\" requiring an urgent response, which is a more detailed and specific scenario. They share the core concept of urgency and immediacy, but the Generated Rule narrows the context to emergency situations with imminent danger, potentially excluding urgent requests that are not emergencies. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
