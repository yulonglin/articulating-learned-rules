The ground truth specifies URLs beginning with 'http' or 'www', while the generated rule broadens this to include 'https://' and explicitly mentions 'http://' as well, which are common URL schemes. The core concept—presence of a URL—is consistent, and both rules ignore other words. The slight difference is that the generated rule explicitly includes 'https://' and 'http://', which are typical URL prefixes, aligning closely with the ground truth. Overall, they are nearly equivalent in logic, with only minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
