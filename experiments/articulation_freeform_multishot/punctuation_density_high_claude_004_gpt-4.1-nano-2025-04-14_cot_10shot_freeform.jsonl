The generated rule emphasizes the presence of multiple exclamation marks or ellipses to convey emotion or emphasis, classifying texts as TRUE based on specific punctuation patterns associated with heightened emotion.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation, their key features differ:  \n- The ground truth uses a quantitative threshold (percentage of total characters).  \n- The generated rule relies on qualitative patterns (multiple exclamation marks or ellipses) linked to emotional emphasis.\n\nThey may overlap in many cases—texts with heavy punctuation likely contain multiple exclamation marks or ellipses—but they are not identical. For example, a text with many punctuation marks spread out evenly might meet the 15% threshold but lack the specific emotional punctuation patterns. Conversely, a text with multiple exclamation marks but fewer total characters might be classified as TRUE by the generated rule but not necessarily by the ground truth if the overall punctuation percentage is below 15%.\n\nTherefore, they describe related but not equivalent classification logics, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
