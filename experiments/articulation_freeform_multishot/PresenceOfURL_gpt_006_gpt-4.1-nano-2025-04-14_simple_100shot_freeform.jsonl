The Generated Rule, however, requires both the presence of a URL (including 'http', 'https', or 'www') and at least one specific keyword (\"run,\" \"check,\" \"dog,\" \"fox,\" \"cat,\" \"world,\" \"lazy,\" \"input\") to classify as true. This introduces an additional condition that is not present in the ground truth, making the generated rule more restrictive and potentially leading to different classifications. While both rules consider URL patterns, the generated rule's reliance on specific keywords means they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Therefore, they do not produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
