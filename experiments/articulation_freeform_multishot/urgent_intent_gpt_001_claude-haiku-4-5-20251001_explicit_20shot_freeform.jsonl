The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on \"immediate, life-threatening emergency or critical situation.\" Both mention urgency and the need for prompt response. However, the Ground Truth is somewhat broader and less specific about the nature of the emergency, while the Generated Rule explicitly includes life-threatening or critical situations and provides examples. The core concept of urgency and immediate action is consistent, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
