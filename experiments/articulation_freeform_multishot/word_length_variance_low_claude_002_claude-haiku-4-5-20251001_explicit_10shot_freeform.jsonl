This suggests a focus on the uniformity or consistency of word lengths within the text. In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence or absence of certain common words (e.g., \"dog,\" \"run,\" \"the\")—a lexical, content-based criterion rather than a statistical property of word lengths. These rules do not target the same features: one examines the distribution of word lengths, the other the inclusion of specific words. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could have low variance in word length without containing any of the specified words, or vice versa. The core concepts—statistical distribution versus specific word presence—are fundamentally different, making their equivalence minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
