This approach is objective and based on the statistical properties of the text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, is qualitative and based on the length, simplicity, and expressive nature of the text (e.g., single words, interjections, brief affirmations). It emphasizes the form and perceived straightforwardness rather than the statistical character distribution.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify \"simple\" or \"predictable\" texts, they do so via different criteria: one through a measurable entropy threshold, the other through subjective linguistic features. They may overlap in many cases (short, simple texts likely have low entropy), but they are not guaranteed to produce identical classifications, especially for texts that are short but complex (e.g., a short but highly variable phrase) or long but repetitive.\n\nTherefore, they describe related but not equivalent classification logic, leading to a low to moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
