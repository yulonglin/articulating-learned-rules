The Ground Truth specifies two specific formats: 'DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year'. The Generated Rule mentions \"various formats\" with examples like \"October 17, 2022\" and \"25/3/2024,\" indicating it covers at least these two formats and possibly others. \n\nThey share the core concept of detecting dates in different formats. However, the Ground Truth explicitly limits to two formats, while the Generated Rule suggests a broader, more flexible pattern recognition, which could include additional formats not specified in the Ground Truth. \n\nGiven that the core idea—detecting dates—is consistent, and most inputs containing these key formats would be classified similarly, the rules are largely aligned. The slight difference in scope (specific formats vs. various formats) accounts for the high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
