This is a broad condition focusing solely on the case of all alphabetic characters, regardless of word boundaries or specific words.\n\nThe generated rule, however, requires the input to contain at least one capitalized word that belongs to a specific set of allowed words. It also implies that if no such allowed capitalized word exists, the output is False. This introduces a set of \"special\" words that must be present in uppercase for the input to be classified as True, which is a more restrictive condition.\n\nWhile both rules involve uppercase letters, the ground truth rule considers the overall case of the entire input, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of specific capitalized words. They may produce similar results when the entire input is uppercase and contains only allowed words, but they diverge when the input contains uppercase letters outside the allowed set or mixed case.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their agreement on most inputs is limited.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
