It emphasizes the sequence of word lengths, not the content or nature of the words themselves. In contrast, the generated rule centers on the presence of gibberish tokens—non-dictionary, random character strings—and their density within the text, regardless of word length patterns. These rules target fundamentally different features: one is about numerical length sequences, the other about linguistic or character-based properties. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications across most inputs, as they rely on different cues. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and they do not identify the same key features or patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
