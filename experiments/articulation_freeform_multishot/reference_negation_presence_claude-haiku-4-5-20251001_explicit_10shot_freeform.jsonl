It focuses solely on the presence of specific negation terms.  \n\nThe generated rule classifies texts based on the frequency of words: it labels a text as true if at least one word appears exactly once, and false if all words are repeated at least twice. This approach is entirely different conceptually, as it relies on word repetition patterns rather than negation cues.  \n\nWhile both rules produce binary classifications, their criteria are unrelated. The ground truth rule is about detecting negation words, whereas the generated rule is about word frequency distribution. They do not identify the same features or patterns, and their classifications will often differ.  \n\nTherefore, the two rules are not equivalent, and the similarity score is low.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
