The Ground Truth explicitly states \"contains at least one word with a hyphen connecting two parts,\" which aligns with the Generated Rule's description of \"words with hyphens\" such as \"well-known\" or \"state-of-the-art.\" The only minor difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly lists examples, but this does not change the core logic. They identify the same key feature—presence of hyphenated words—and would produce identical classifications in most cases. The slight difference in phrasing and example inclusion accounts for a near-perfect score rather than a perfect 10.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
