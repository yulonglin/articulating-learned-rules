Looking at False cases: \"brown the check\", \"example value test over\", \"lazy hello sat\"\n   - These appear to be all lowercase or normal capitalization\n\n3. Checking more carefully:\n   - True cases seem to have at least one word with non-standard capitalization (mixed case like \"TeXt\", \"ThE\", \"FuNcTiOn\", \"RuN\", \"VaLuE\", etc.)\n   - False cases either have no mixed-case words, or only standard capitalization\n\n4.

The generated rule, however, broadly states that a word has mixed-case letters with \"capitals appearing in non-standard positions,\" which is less precise and could include any non-uniform casing pattern, not necessarily strict alternation. While both rules aim to identify words with non-uniform casing, the ground truth emphasizes a specific alternating pattern, whereas the generated rule is more general and potentially captures a wider set of patterns. They may agree on many inputs with strict alternation, but the generated rule could also classify words that do not meet the specific alternating pattern, leading to discrepancies. Therefore, they are related but not fully equivalent in their core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
