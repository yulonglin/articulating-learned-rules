In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of repeated words, focusing on redundancy or repetition. These are fundamentally different features: one measures word length distribution, the other measures word repetition. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could have consistent word lengths without repetitions, or contain repeated words with variable lengths. The core concepts—word length variance versus word repetition—are not equivalent, making the rules largely unrelated in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
