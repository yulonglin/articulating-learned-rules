The Ground Truth explicitly specifies two date formats: 'DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year'. The Generated Rule broadly states that the input contains a date reference involving month name or number, day, and year, without specifying exact formats. They share the core concept of detecting date references, but the generated rule is more general and less precise about formats. As a result, they would likely produce similar classifications on many inputs containing standard date formats, but the generated rule might also classify some inputs as positive that do not match the exact formats specified in the ground truth, or miss some that do. Overall, they are conceptually aligned but differ in specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
