It classifies texts based on whether the sequence of word lengths matches this particular numeric pattern for at least the first five words. In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of both unique words and non-English (gibberish) words, emphasizing lexical features rather than structural length patterns.\n\nThese two rules target fundamentally different aspects: one is about the numerical pattern of word lengths, the other about the lexical composition and presence of nonsense words. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ on the same input. For example, a text with Fibonacci-length words but all real words would be positive under the ground truth but negative under the generated rule. Conversely, a text with gibberish and unique words but no Fibonacci pattern would be positive under the generated rule but negative under the ground truth.\n\nTherefore, they are not equivalent in core concept, and their classification outputs would rarely align, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
