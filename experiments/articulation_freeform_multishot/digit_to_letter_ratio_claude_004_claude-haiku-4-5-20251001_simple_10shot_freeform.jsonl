In contrast, the generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains specific, concrete identifiers like tracking or flight numbers, and FALSE if it contains general or non-specific references. The core features differ: one relies on a measurable ratio of character types, while the other depends on the presence of particular types of information (specific identifiers). They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ on the same input. Therefore, they are largely different in concept and would rarely produce the same classification, resulting in a low score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
