The generated rule explicitly states removing spaces, punctuation, and case before checking for palindrome, which aligns closely with the ground truth rule that ignores spaces and case (though the ground truth does not explicitly mention punctuation). The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly includes punctuation removal, making it slightly more comprehensive. In practice, this difference is minimal because ignoring punctuation is a common extension of ignoring spaces and case. Therefore, they identify the same key pattern—palindromic structure under normalized conditions—and would produce identical classifications on most inputs, with a very minor potential divergence if the ground truth does not consider punctuation. Overall, they are effectively equivalent in intent and outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
