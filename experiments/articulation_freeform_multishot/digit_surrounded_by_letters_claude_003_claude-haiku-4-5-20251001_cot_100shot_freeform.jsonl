The generated rule, however, describes detecting a specific suffix pattern (a letter-digit-letter sequence at the end) combined with the presence of programming/technical keywords, and classifies based on whether the input is a complete English sentence without such suffixes. While both rules involve patterns with digits and letters, the ground truth emphasizes an embedded pattern anywhere in the text, whereas the generated rule emphasizes a suffix pattern at the end and the presence of technical keywords. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classification criteria differ significantly. Therefore, they are only loosely related and do not describe the same logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
