They contain the exact same letters.\n- \"quick\", \"brown\", and \"data\" are not anagrams of common words (or at least not obvious ones).\n\nWait, let me reconsider: Could it be about whether the word contains certain letters?\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- \"enlist\" has: e, n, l, i, s, t\n- \"listen\" has: l, i, s, t, e, n (same letters!)\n\nBoth True cases are anagrams of each other. But that seems too specific.\n\nLet me check if all True words can be rearranged into another valid English word, or if they contain a specific subset of letters... Actually, both \"enlist\" and \"listen\" are valid English words that are anagrams of each other.\n\n**Rule:** A word is classified as True if it is an anagram of another common English word (or specifically, if its letters can be rearranged to form a different valid English word).","keyword_match_score":0.42857142857142855,"rouge_l_score":0.3333333333333333,"llm_judge_score":0.8,"llm_judge_reasoning":"Both rules focus on identifying words that are anagrams of common English words, specifically referencing \"listen,\" \"below,\" and \"study\" as examples. The Ground Truth emphasizes that any word is an anagram of these common words, implying a broad pattern of anagrammatic relationships with familiar words. The Generated Rule explicitly states that a word is classified as true if it can be rearranged into another valid English word, which aligns closely with the core concept of the ground truth. \n\nHowever, the generated rule introduces the idea of \"another\" common English word, which slightly broadens the scope beyond the specific examples provided in the ground truth. The ground truth's mention of specific words suggests a focus on particular known anagrams, whereas the generated rule generalizes to any anagram of any common English word. \n\nDespite this slight difference in scope, the core pattern—words being anagrams of common English words—is consistent. Therefore, they are largely equivalent in their classification logic, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6304347826086957,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":46,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":4,"accuracy":0.6304347826086957},"parse_error":false}
