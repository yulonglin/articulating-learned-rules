The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria to include either such a mixed-case word or the presence of at least two repeated words, which is unrelated to letter casing patterns. While both rules involve identifying certain features within the text, their core concepts differ significantly: one centers on letter case patterns within words, and the other on word repetition or mixed case. They may produce similar outputs in some cases where a mixed-case word is present, but the inclusion of repeated words in the generated rule introduces a different classification logic. Therefore, they are not equivalent in their key features or overall logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
