The generated rule centers on the presence of uncertainty or doubt indicators (question marks, ellipses, hesitation markers) to determine truthfulness, with a distinction based on certainty in statements or commands. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; one is based on punctuation density, the other on semantic cues related to uncertainty. They would likely produce different classifications on most inputs, especially those with heavy punctuation but no uncertainty indicators, or vice versa. The core concepts—punctuation density versus semantic expression of doubt—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
