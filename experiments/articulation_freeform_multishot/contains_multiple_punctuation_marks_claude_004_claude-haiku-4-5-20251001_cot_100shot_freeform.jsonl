Inputs without any such punctuation marks are classified as **False**.","raw_response":"Let me analyze the patterns in the True and False cases.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. **Punctuation/Special Characters**: True cases almost always contain punctuation marks (`,`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `;`, `:`) or multiple instances of them, while False cases tend to have fewer or no special characters.\n\n2. **Word Patterns**: Let me check if certain words appear more in True vs False:\n   - False cases often contain: \"input\", \"check\", \"test\", \"world\", \"sample\", \"data\" appearing together\n   - True cases seem to have more varied word combinations\n\n3. **Specific observation**: Looking more carefully:\n   - False cases often have clean, simple word lists without punctuation\n   - True cases frequently have punctuation embedded within or between words\n   - When I count words in False cases: they tend to be 2-5 words with no punctuation\n   - True cases: have punctuation marks scattered throughout\n\n4. **Key insight**: The presence of special characters (`,`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `;`, `:`) seems to be a strong indicator of True, while their absence correlates with False.\n\n**Rule:**\n\nThe input is classified as **True** if it contains at least one special punctuation character (such as `,`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `;`, or `:`) embedded within or between words.

The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if it contains at least one special punctuation character from the same set, emphasizing the presence of any such punctuation rather than the count. Additionally, the generated rule mentions punctuation embedded within or between words, which is consistent with typical punctuation usage but broadens the context.\n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation from the same set, the key difference is the threshold: the ground truth requires three or more punctuation marks, whereas the generated rule requires only at least one. This difference means they will not produce identical classifications in many cases—inputs with fewer than three punctuation marks but at least one will be classified as True by the generated rule but False by the ground truth. Conversely, inputs with three or more punctuation marks will be classified as True by both.\n\nIn summary, they share the core concept of punctuation from the same set but differ significantly in the counting criterion and emphasis, leading to only partial overlap in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
