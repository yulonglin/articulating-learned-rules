The generated rule broadly classifies texts based on the presence of any \"alphanumeric code,\" such as a letter-digit or digit-letter sequence, which is a more general pattern. While both rules involve patterns of letters and digits, the ground truth emphasizes a very specific context (digits surrounded by letters), whereas the generated rule considers any mixed letter-digit sequence anywhere in the text, including patterns like \"y3u\" or \"h6d\" but not necessarily requiring the digit to be flanked by letters on both sides. Therefore, they overlap in some cases but are not fully equivalent in scope or specificity.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
