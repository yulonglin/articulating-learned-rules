The generated rule, however, classifies texts as TRUE only if the entire input is a repeated sequence of a single character (or identical characters) at least three times, i.e., a uniform string of repeated characters.  \n\nWhile both rules are related to repetition, the ground truth rule is broader, capturing texts with limited character diversity, which can include non-uniform but repetitive patterns, whereas the generated rule is more restrictive, requiring the entire string to be a single repeated character sequence. They overlap in identifying highly repetitive or low-diversity strings but differ in scope and pattern specificity. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and would not necessarily produce identical outputs on all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.52,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.52},"parse_error":false}
