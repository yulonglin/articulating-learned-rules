Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic, and their classifications would often differ.\n\nOverall, the core concepts are different, and the rules would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
