This captures a broad pattern of consecutive repeated characters, regardless of specific words or substrings.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, only marks inputs as True if they contain the substring \"ssippi\" or the letter \"c\" (implying words like \"mississippi\" or \"committee\"). This is a much narrower criterion, focusing on specific words or patterns rather than general repeated characters.  \n\nWhile both rules may sometimes classify the same inputs (e.g., \"mississippi\" contains \"ssippi\" and repeated \"ss\"), the generated rule misses many inputs with consecutive repeated characters that do not contain \"ssippi\" or \"c\". Conversely, the ground truth rule would classify any input with any repeated character, regardless of whether it contains those specific substrings.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would not produce identical classifications on most inputs. The core concepts differ: one is based on any repeated character, the other on specific substrings and letters.  \n\nOverall, the rules are related but not equivalent in scope or logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
