The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the generated rule extends this to ignore punctuation as well, which is a broader criterion. Despite this slight difference, in most practical scenarios, both rules will produce the same classifications, especially since ignoring punctuation is a common extension when checking for palindromes. The core concept—identifying palindromic sequences—is consistent, making them nearly equivalent in intent and outcome. The main difference is the inclusion of punctuation in the generated rule, which may lead to minor discrepancies in edge cases.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
