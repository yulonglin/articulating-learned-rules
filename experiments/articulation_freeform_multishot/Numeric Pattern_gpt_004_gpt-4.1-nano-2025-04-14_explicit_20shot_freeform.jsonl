The generated rule, however, specifies a classification based on a phrase \"Meeting on\" followed by a valid date in recognized month names or numeric formats, which is a more restrictive pattern. It introduces an additional contextual requirement (\"Meeting on\") that the ground truth rule does not specify. Therefore, while both rules involve detecting dates, they differ significantly in the conditions under which classification occurs, leading to different classifications on many inputs. They share the core concept of date detection but differ in scope and context, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
