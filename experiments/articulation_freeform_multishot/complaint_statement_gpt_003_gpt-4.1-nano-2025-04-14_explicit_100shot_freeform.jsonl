The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule describes labeling based on negative experiences, problems, or dissatisfaction, and positive/neutral experiences as False. They largely overlap in identifying negative content as True. However, the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, which may be slightly narrower than the broader \"negative experiences, problems, or dissatisfaction\" in the generated rule. The generated rule also explicitly includes positive, neutral, or satisfactory experiences as False, aligning with the idea of not labeling positive or neutral as True. Overall, they share the core concept of detecting negative sentiment related to products or experiences, making them closely aligned but with minor differences in phrasing and scope.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
