The generated rule, however, classifies a text as True if it contains at least one embedded or attached special character within words, emphasizing the presence of embedded punctuation rather than the count or specific set. While both rules involve punctuation, their core features differ: the ground truth emphasizes quantity and specific punctuation types, whereas the generated rule emphasizes embedded or attached punctuation within words. They may occasionally overlap (e.g., texts with multiple embedded punctuations might also have multiple punctuation marks overall), but generally, they target different patterns. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic, and their classifications would often differ.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
