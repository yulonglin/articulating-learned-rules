The ground truth rule specifies two date formats: 'DD/MM/YYYY' and 'Month Day, Year'. The generated rule also includes 'D/M/YYYY' and 'D/M/YY' formats, which are similar but slightly broader, and explicitly mentions \"indicating a meeting date,\" adding context not present in the ground truth.  \n\nThey share the core concept of detecting specific date patterns, but the generated rule introduces additional formats ('D/M/YY') and contextual wording (\"indicating a meeting date\") that are not in the ground truth. This could lead to differences in classification for inputs with other date formats or contexts.  \n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in identifying key date patterns but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
