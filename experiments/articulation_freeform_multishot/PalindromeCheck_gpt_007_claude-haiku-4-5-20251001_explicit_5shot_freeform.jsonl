The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the generated rule mentions ignoring spaces and punctuation, which is a broader criterion. If the generated rule's mention of punctuation is interpreted as ignoring punctuation in addition to spaces, then it aligns closely with the ground truth. The main difference is that the generated rule explicitly includes punctuation, potentially making it slightly more inclusive. Overall, they identify the same key pattern—palindromic sequences under case and space/punctuation insensitivity—and would produce very similar classifications on most inputs. The slight discrepancy in wording leads to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
