The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain 2 or fewer words, and False otherwise. While both rules focus on the number of words, they differ in the thresholds: the ground truth allows up to 4 words for True, whereas the generated rule restricts True to only 2 words. Consequently, the generated rule is more restrictive and will classify some inputs with 3 or 4 words as False, whereas the ground truth would classify them as True. They share the core concept of word count-based classification but differ in the specific cutoff, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
