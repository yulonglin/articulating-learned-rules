The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which captures the core idea of urgency. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"immediate, life-threatening, or critical emergency situations\" and explicitly mentions specific examples like fires, medical crises, security threats, evacuations, or system failures, which align with the core concept of urgent emergencies. Both rules exclude routine or non-emergency communications.\n\nHowever, the Ground Truth is somewhat more general and less detailed about the types of emergencies or the severity levels, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly mentions life-threatening or critical situations and provides examples. This difference might lead to slight variations in classification, especially in borderline cases. Overall, they largely identify the same key features and patterns, making their core concepts equivalent, but the added specificity in the Generated Rule accounts for a slightly lower score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
