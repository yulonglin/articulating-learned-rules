This focuses on the statistical measure of character variability and predictability.  \n\nThe generated rule emphasizes the length, simplicity, and content richness of the text—classifying very short, trivial, or minimal content as TRUE, and longer, meaningful, or idiomatic expressions as FALSE. This approach is more about content complexity and length rather than character-level entropy.  \n\nWhile both rules tend to classify very short, simple, or predictable texts as TRUE, they do so based on different underlying features: one on character entropy, the other on content and length. They may overlap in some cases but are not strictly equivalent in logic or feature focus. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features nor guarantee identical classifications across all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
