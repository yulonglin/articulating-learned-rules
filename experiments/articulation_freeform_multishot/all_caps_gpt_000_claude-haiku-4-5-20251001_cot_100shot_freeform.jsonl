The ground truth specifies that *all* alphabetic characters must be uppercase and that there must be at least one letter. The generated rule states that *all words* are in uppercase, ignoring numbers and special characters, which effectively means all alphabetic characters in each word are uppercase, and that every word is uppercase. \n\nWhile they align closely, the generated rule's focus on entire words being uppercase (and ignoring non-letter characters) may allow some inputs that the ground truth would classify differently—particularly if the input contains mixed-case words or non-letter characters that the ground truth considers. \n\nOverall, they target similar patterns but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
