The Ground Truth emphasizes conveying a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the expression of internal emotions. The Generated Rule explicitly states that texts describing emotional states, feelings, or affective experiences qualify as true, while those describing physical scenes, objects, actions, or sensory details do not.\n\nThe core concept—distinguishing emotional/internal states from external descriptions—is consistent across both rules. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions \"feelings\" and \"affective experiences,\" which aligns with the Ground Truth's focus on emotional states. Both rules would generally produce similar classifications, especially when the text clearly references internal emotions.\n\nHowever, the Ground Truth's phrasing (\"conveys a clear emotional state\") leaves some ambiguity about whether subtle or implied emotions are included, whereas the Generated Rule explicitly states \"describe or reference emotional states,\" which might be slightly broader or more explicit.\n\nOverall, the core logic and patterns are aligned, leading to a high degree of equivalence, but minor differences in phrasing and scope prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
