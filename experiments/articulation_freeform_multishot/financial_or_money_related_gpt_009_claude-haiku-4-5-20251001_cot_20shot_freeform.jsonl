The Ground Truth specifies that the text \"discusses topics related to\" these areas, implying a focus on content relevance. The Generated Rule states that the input should be classified as **True** if it discusses financial, economic, investment, banking, or wealth-related concepts and principles, and **False** otherwise. \n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one emphasizes \"discusses topics related to\" and the other \"discusses ... concepts and principles\"—the core pattern of identifying relevant subject matter is similar. Both rules focus on the presence of financial or economic themes. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"economic\" and \"wealth-related\" concepts, which slightly broadens the scope compared to the Ground Truth, which centers on finance, money, banking, or investments. \n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying the same key features and would produce similar classifications in most cases, but the slight difference in scope and phrasing accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
