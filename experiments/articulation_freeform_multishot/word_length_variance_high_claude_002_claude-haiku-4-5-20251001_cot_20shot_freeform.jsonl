In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of complex, multi-syllabic words versus simple, short words. While both rules relate to word characteristics, they target different features: one emphasizes quantitative variability in length, the other emphasizes qualitative complexity of vocabulary. They may sometimes align (e.g., texts with very long or very short words), but generally, they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
