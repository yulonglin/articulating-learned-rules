The Generated Rule, however, emphasizes whether the content discusses abstract concepts, systems, or general principles like economics or business mechanisms, and explicitly excludes personal experiences or concrete activities. While there is some overlap—both rules tend to include discussions about finance and economics—the Generated Rule introduces a broader emphasis on abstraction and generality, which is not explicitly present in the Ground Truth Rule. Consequently, they may produce similar classifications in many cases but can diverge when the content is more abstract or more concrete, leading to partial overlap rather than perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
