The generated rule classifies texts as TRUE if there is at least one repeated word, focusing on the presence of duplicate words regardless of their length or distribution. These are fundamentally different features: one measures the uniformity of word lengths, the other detects repeated words. They may occasionally coincide (e.g., sentences with uniform word lengths often contain repeated words), but generally, they identify different patterns. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic and are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
