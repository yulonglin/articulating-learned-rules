The Ground Truth rule emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on the content's explicit negative sentiment. The Generated rule categorizes statements as positive or negative based on whether they express complaints or dissatisfaction, with a neutral or praise focus as False. While the phrasing differs—one emphasizes explicit statements, the other uses a broader positive/negative classification—they largely align in identifying negative or critical content. Minor differences may arise in edge cases where a statement is subtly negative or neutral but not explicitly critical, but overall, they describe similar classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
