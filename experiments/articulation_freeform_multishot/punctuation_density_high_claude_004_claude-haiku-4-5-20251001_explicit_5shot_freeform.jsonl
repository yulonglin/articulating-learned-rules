The generated rule classifies texts as TRUE based on the presence of uncertainty, doubt, or questioning indicators (e.g., ellipses, question marks, hedging, hesitation), which are qualitative features related to tone and intent. These two rules target different aspects: one focuses on punctuation density, the other on linguistic cues of uncertainty. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, as a text could have heavy punctuation without expressing uncertainty, or vice versa. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, do not produce the same classifications on most inputs, and are not core conceptually equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
