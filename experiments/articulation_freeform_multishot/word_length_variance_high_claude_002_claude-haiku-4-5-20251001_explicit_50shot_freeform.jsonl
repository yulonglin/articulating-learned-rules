This approach is quantitative and pattern-agnostic, focusing solely on the distribution of word lengths regardless of the actual words or their order.\n\nThe generated rule, on the other hand, relies on a specific syntactic pattern (\"I am [long words]\") and the complexity of the words (polysyllabic, Latin/Greek roots). It explicitly looks for a particular phrase and word characteristics, not on the overall distribution of word lengths.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify texts with \"complex\" or \"inconsistent\" word features, they do so via fundamentally different criteria: one statistical, the other pattern-based. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., a phrase with long words might also have high variance in word lengths), but they are not equivalent in general.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications will often differ. The core concepts—statistical variance vs. pattern matching—are different, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
