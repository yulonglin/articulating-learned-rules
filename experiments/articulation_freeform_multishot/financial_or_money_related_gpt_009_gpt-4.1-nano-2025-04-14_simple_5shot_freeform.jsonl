The Ground Truth rule explicitly mentions topics like finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on subject matter. The Generated rule emphasizes whether the sentence discusses a financial or economic concept, event, or terminology, and excludes general activities, locations, or non-financial subjects. While phrasing differs, the core pattern—identifying financial/economic relevance—is similar. They would largely produce the same classifications, though the Generated rule's broader mention of \"concept, event, or terminology\" might include some nuances not explicitly covered by the Ground Truth. Overall, their key features and core concepts are aligned, making them quite similar in classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
