The ground truth specifies patterns starting with 'http' or 'www', while the generated rule explicitly includes 'http://', 'https://', and 'www.'—which are more precise URL prefixes. They identify similar key features, but the generated rule's inclusion of 'https://' and explicit mention of 'http://' makes it slightly more comprehensive. On most inputs, they would produce similar classifications, but the slight difference in pattern specificity (e.g., whether 'http' alone suffices in the ground truth) accounts for the small gap. Overall, their core concepts are aligned, but the phrasing and pattern details differ slightly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
