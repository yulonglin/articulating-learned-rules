The Ground Truth emphasizes a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, which broadly covers both positive and negative emotions. The Generated Rule specifically emphasizes positive emotions and well-being, labeling neutral or negative scenes as false. While the core concept of identifying emotional content is shared, the Ground Truth is more inclusive of various emotional states (positive and negative), whereas the Generated Rule centers primarily on positive emotions and well-being. Therefore, they largely overlap but are not perfectly aligned in scope, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
