The generated rule, however, centers on internal emotional or psychological states expressed poetically via figurative language, and explicitly excludes external sensory perceptions and physical/environmental observations. While both rules aim to identify emotional content, the generated rule narrows the scope to poetic or figurative expressions of internal states, potentially excluding straightforward emotional statements that are not poetic. Conversely, the ground truth rule encompasses any clear emotional state, regardless of expression style. Therefore, they overlap partially but are not fully aligned, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
