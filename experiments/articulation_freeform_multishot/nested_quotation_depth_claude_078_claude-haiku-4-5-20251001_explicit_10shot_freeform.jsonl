This emphasizes the presence of nested quotation marks, regardless of whether they are escaped or not.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses solely on the presence of escaped quotes (`\\\"`) within quoted speech, which is a different pattern. It does not explicitly require nesting of quotes; it only checks for escaped quotation marks.  \n\nWhile both rules relate to quotes within quotes, the ground truth emphasizes nesting depth, whereas the generated rule emphasizes escaped characters. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., nested quotes often involve escaping), but they are not equivalent in scope or focus. The generated rule could classify texts with escaped quotes but no nesting, and vice versa.  \n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their core concepts differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
