The generated rule centers on qualitative cues—expressions of excitement, surprise, or emphasis through exclamation marks, interjections, or rhetorical questions—implying strong reactions. While both involve punctuation as a key feature, their core concepts differ: one uses a strict numerical threshold on punctuation density, the other relies on specific expressive patterns. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., texts with many exclamation marks), but generally, they identify different features and would likely produce different classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
