The Ground Truth requires at least two exclamation marks for a True label, while the Generated Rule classifies any input with one or more exclamation marks as True. They will produce identical classifications for inputs with zero or at least two exclamation marks, but differ for inputs with exactly one exclamation mark—under the Ground Truth, such input would be False, whereas under the Generated Rule, it would be True. Therefore, they are very similar but not perfectly equivalent, leading to a high score but not a perfect one.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
