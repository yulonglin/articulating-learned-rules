It emphasizes a pattern involving a digit sandwiched between letters, regardless of whether they are part of words or standalone characters.\n\nThe generated rule, however, specifies that the input contains at least one lowercase word (excluding common year references) that includes a letter immediately followed by a digit (e.g., \"b2m\"). It looks for a letter-digit pattern within words, specifically within lowercase words, and explicitly excludes certain year references.\n\nWhile both rules involve patterns of letters and digits, they differ in key aspects:\n- The ground truth considers any occurrence of a digit with a letter immediately before and after, regardless of whether they are within words or separate characters.\n- The generated rule restricts to lowercase words and looks for a letter directly followed by a digit within those words, not necessarily requiring the digit to be between two letters.\n\nThey share a common theme of letter-digit adjacency but differ in scope and specific pattern matching. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent, and they would not necessarily produce the same classifications on all inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
