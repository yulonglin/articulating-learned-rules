The Ground Truth emphasizes an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" while the Generated Rule specifies \"urgent request for immediate help or action related to emergencies or hazards.\" The core concept of urgency and immediate response is consistent, but the Generated Rule explicitly ties the request to emergencies or hazards, which may broaden or narrow the scope slightly. Overall, they largely align in identifying urgent calls for action, but the phrasing and scope differences prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
