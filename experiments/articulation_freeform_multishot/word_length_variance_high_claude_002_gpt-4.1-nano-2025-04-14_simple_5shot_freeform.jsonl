The generated rule, however, classifies texts as TRUE if there is at least one very long word (more than 10 letters), focusing on the presence of a single long word rather than the overall variability. These rules do not identify the same key features or patterns; they may often produce different classifications, especially in texts with many short words but high variance, or texts with no very long words but high variance. The core concepts—variance in word length versus presence of a long word—are different, so they are not equivalent in logic or outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
