The ground truth emphasizes the presence of \"at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which directly captures the core pattern. The generated rule clarifies that the word must be palindromic and provides examples, but the essential logic remains the same: identifying at least one palindromic word within the text. The slight difference is that the generated rule explicitly states \"a word that reads identically forwards and backwards,\" which is a precise definition of a palindrome, whereas the ground truth uses a more informal description. Overall, they describe the same classification logic, with only minor differences in phrasing and detail.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
