The Ground Truth emphasizes the first-person perspective and personal, introspective language, which inherently captures subjective inner experiences. The Generated Rule explicitly categorizes statements as true if they express internal emotional states, personal reflections, or subjective feelings, and false if they describe external observations or objective facts. While the phrasing differs—one centers on perspective and language cues, the other on emotional and subjective content—the core concept of differentiating internal, subjective experiences from external, objective descriptions is aligned. The main difference is that the Ground Truth rule emphasizes linguistic perspective (first-person), whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes emotional and subjective content explicitly. Overall, they largely overlap in intent and pattern recognition, but slight differences in focus prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
