The Ground Truth emphasizes third-person perspective and human agency, while the Generated rule categorizes based on whether the content is human-centered or scene-centered. They largely overlap in identifying human-centric versus scene/atmosphere descriptions, but differ slightly in phrasing and scope. The Ground Truth explicitly mentions perspective and pronouns, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes concrete actions and characteristics versus atmospheric imagery. Overall, they are closely aligned in core concept but differ in specific criteria and wording, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
