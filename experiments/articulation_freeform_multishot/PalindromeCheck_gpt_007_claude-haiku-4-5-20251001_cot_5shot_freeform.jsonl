The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the generated rule extends this to ignore punctuation as well. This slight difference means they will produce identical classifications on most inputs, especially those that are simple palindromes without punctuation. The core concept—identifying palindromes under a normalization that ignores spaces and case—is essentially the same. The main difference is the inclusion of punctuation in the generated rule, which may cause minor discrepancies in some edge cases. Overall, they are functionally equivalent in intent and most practical scenarios.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
