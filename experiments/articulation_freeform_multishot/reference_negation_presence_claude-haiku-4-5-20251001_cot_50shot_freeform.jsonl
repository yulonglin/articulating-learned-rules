The set {no, the} does not reliably indicate negation or negativity—\"the\" is a common article, not a negation indicator. Therefore, the two rules do not identify the same key features, would rarely produce the same classifications, and their core concepts are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.54,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":27,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.54},"parse_error":false}
