It captures a particular structural pattern within the text. The generated rule, however, broadens the criteria significantly by classifying texts as True if they contain certain keywords (\"check,\" \"code,\" \"world,\" \"brown,\" \"hello\") or the same letter-digit-letter pattern. While both rules recognize the letter-digit-letter pattern, the generated rule introduces additional keyword-based conditions that are not part of the ground truth. Therefore, they do not identify exactly the same features, and their classifications will differ on many inputs—particularly those containing the keywords but lacking the specific pattern, or vice versa. The core concept of pattern detection is shared, but the overall logic and scope differ substantially.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
