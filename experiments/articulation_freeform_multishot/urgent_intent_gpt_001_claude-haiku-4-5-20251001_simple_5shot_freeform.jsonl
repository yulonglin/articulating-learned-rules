The Ground Truth emphasizes \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the immediacy and urgency. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"urgent, emergency, or critical situation\" requiring immediate action to prevent harm, which aligns closely with the core concept of urgency and criticality. Both rules exclude routine or non-emergency messages. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions preventing harm or danger and includes \"emergency\" and \"critical\" situations, which slightly broadens the scope. Overall, they largely identify the same key features and would produce similar classifications, but the Generated Rule's broader phrasing introduces minor differences.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
