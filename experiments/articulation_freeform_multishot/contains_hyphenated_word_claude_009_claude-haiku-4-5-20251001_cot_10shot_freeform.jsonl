The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if it contains at least one word from a specific set of allowed words, which includes \"well-known\" among others. While \"well-known\" is explicitly included in the allowed set, the generated rule's reliance on a predefined list of words means it may miss other hyphenated words not in that list, and it may incorrectly classify inputs containing allowed words that are not hyphenated. Therefore, both rules are not entirely equivalent: the ground truth depends on hyphenation patterns, whereas the generated rule depends on specific word membership. They may produce similar results in some cases (e.g., \"well-known\" is both hyphenated and in the allowed set), but they are not fundamentally the same logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
