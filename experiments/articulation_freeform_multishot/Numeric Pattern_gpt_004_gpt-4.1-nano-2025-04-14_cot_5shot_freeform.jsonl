The generated rule, however, classifies inputs as positive only if they mention a scheduled event (e.g., \"Meeting on\") with a date, implying a contextual focus on scheduled meetings rather than any date mention. While both rules involve date detection, the ground truth is pattern-based and format-specific, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the context of scheduled events. They share some overlap—both recognize date mentions—but differ significantly in scope and intent. The generated rule is more restrictive and context-dependent, so they do not produce identical classifications across most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
