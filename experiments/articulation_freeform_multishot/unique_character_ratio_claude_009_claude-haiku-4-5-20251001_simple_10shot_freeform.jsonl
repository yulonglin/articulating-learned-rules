This approach broadly captures texts with repetitive or limited character sets, regardless of specific patterns.\n\nThe generated rule, however, specifically targets inputs composed of repeated single letters or digraphs separated by spaces, and classifies such inputs as TRUE, while considering any actual words or multiple different words as FALSE. It emphasizes the pattern of repeated units rather than the overall character variety or ratio.\n\nWhile both rules tend to identify repetitive or low-variety texts as TRUE, they do so based on different criteria: the ground truth uses a quantitative ratio, and the generated rule uses a pattern of repeated units. They may agree on many inputs (e.g., strings of repeated characters), but they diverge on more complex or varied inputs, and the core concepts are not fully aligned.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
