It does not specify any particular set of words or require the presence of specific words.\n\nThe generated rule, however, requires the input to contain only uppercase words (and numbers), with at least one \"valid\" uppercase word from a predefined set. It also explicitly disallows lowercase words. This introduces a more restrictive condition: not only must the input be uppercase, but it must include at least one specific \"valid\" word.\n\nKey differences:\n- The ground truth rule does not specify any set of valid words; it only checks for uppercase characters and the presence of at least one letter.\n- The generated rule emphasizes the presence of certain \"valid\" words, which is not part of the original rule.\n- The ground truth rule allows any uppercase input, while the generated rule restricts to inputs composed solely of uppercase words and numbers, with a subset of valid words.\n\nMost inputs that are fully uppercase and contain at least one letter will be classified as True by the ground truth rule, regardless of whether they contain the specific valid words. Conversely, the generated rule will classify as True only if the input contains only uppercase words (and numbers) and includes at least one valid word from the set.\n\nTherefore, while there is some overlap (both require uppercase and at least one letter), the generated rule's additional constraints mean they will not always produce the same classification, especially in cases where the input is uppercase but does not contain any of the specified valid words.\n\nOverall, they share a core concept of uppercase content but differ significantly in the additional constraints and specific features they require.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
