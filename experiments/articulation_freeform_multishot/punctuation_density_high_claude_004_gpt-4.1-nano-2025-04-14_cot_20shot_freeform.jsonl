The generated rule emphasizes the presence of multiple exclamation or question marks used to convey strong emotion, which is a specific subset of punctuation usage. They do not identify the same key features—one is about overall punctuation percentage, the other about particular punctuation types and their emotional context. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially when punctuation density is high but not necessarily involving multiple exclamation or question marks, or when such marks are used without high overall punctuation. The core concepts differ significantly, making the rules only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
