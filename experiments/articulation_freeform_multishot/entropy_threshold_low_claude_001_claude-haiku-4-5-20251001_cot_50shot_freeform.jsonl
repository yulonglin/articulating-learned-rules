This captures a quantitative measure of predictability and repetition at the character level.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses on explicit patterns such as repetition of characters, words, or patterns, and on the simplicity or brevity of the utterance, classifying complex, varied, or proverb-like phrases as FALSE. It emphasizes specific pattern types and the overall complexity or simplicity of the text rather than a statistical measure of entropy.\n\nWhile both rules aim to identify repetitive or predictable content, the ground truth rule is more general and quantitative, potentially capturing a broader range of predictable texts based on entropy. The generated rule is more qualitative and pattern-based, emphasizing specific features like repetition and simplicity.\n\nThey are related in concept—both target predictability and repetition—but differ significantly in approach and scope. They would likely agree on many obvious repetitive or simple texts but could diverge on more nuanced cases, especially where entropy and pattern-based criteria do not align perfectly.\n\nOverall, they share a core idea but differ in methodology and detail, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
