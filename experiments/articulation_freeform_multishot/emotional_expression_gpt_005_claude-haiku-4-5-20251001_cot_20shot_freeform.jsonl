The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement. The Generated rule broadens this to include feelings and emotional responses, explicitly listing examples like despair, delight, or heartbreak, and clarifies that false cases involve physical actions, sensory observations, or environmental details without emotional content. \n\nWhile the core concept—identifying emotional expression—is consistent, the Generated rule introduces more detailed examples and explicitly differentiates emotional descriptions from non-emotional descriptions, which the Ground Truth does not. This makes their classification logic very similar, but the added detail and explicit examples in the Generated rule make it slightly more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, they largely align in identifying emotional content versus non-emotional content, but the phrasing and scope differences prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
