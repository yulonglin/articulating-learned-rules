This captures a broad pattern of simplicity and repetitiveness. The generated rule, however, focuses on superficial features such as length, complexity, and punctuation, emphasizing that True examples are brief, simple expressions or sounds, while False examples are longer, more complex sentences or idioms. While both rules tend to classify very short, simple, or repetitive texts as True, the generated rule is more about surface-level features rather than the underlying statistical property of entropy. Therefore, they partially overlap in identifying simple, brief expressions but differ in the core logic—one is based on a measurable information-theoretic property, the other on heuristic features. They would likely agree on many obvious cases but diverge on texts where length and punctuation do not directly correlate with entropy.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
