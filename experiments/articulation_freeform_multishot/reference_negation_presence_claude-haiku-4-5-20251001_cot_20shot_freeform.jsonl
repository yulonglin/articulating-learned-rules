The generated rule classifies a text as True if it contains at least one contraction (e.g., \"can't,\" \"don't,\" \"won't\") or a negation word (\"not,\" \"no\"). Since contractions like \"can't\" and \"don't\" inherently contain negation components (\"not\" implied within the contraction), the generated rule captures some negations indirectly. However, the generated rule explicitly includes contractions as a separate feature, which the ground truth rule does not specify. \n\nMost texts containing negation words will be classified similarly by both rules. But the generated rule might classify as positive (True) texts that contain contractions but no explicit negation words (e.g., \"I will go\" with no negation), which the ground truth rule would classify as negative only if it contains negation words. Conversely, the ground truth rule might classify as negative texts that contain negation words but no contractions, which the generated rule would also catch.\n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying negation is similar, but the inclusion of contractions as a separate feature in the generated rule introduces some differences. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
