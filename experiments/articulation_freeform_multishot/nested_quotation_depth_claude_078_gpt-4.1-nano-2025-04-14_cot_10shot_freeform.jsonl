In contrast, the generated rule centers on the semantic content of quoted material—specifically, whether the quoted response is meaningful or an acknowledgment following certain verbs. They do not identify the same key features or patterns: one is about structural nesting, the other about semantic intent and context. Consequently, they would not produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially when the nesting structure differs from the nature of the quoted content.
