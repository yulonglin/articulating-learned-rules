In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE if there is at least one very long word (longer than 10 characters), focusing on the presence of a single long word rather than the overall variability. These rules target different features: the ground truth emphasizes the spread of all word lengths, while the generated rule emphasizes the existence of a specific long word. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially in cases where the variance is high due to many moderately long words but no single word exceeds 10 characters, or vice versa. The core concepts are not equivalent, making the rules fundamentally different in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
