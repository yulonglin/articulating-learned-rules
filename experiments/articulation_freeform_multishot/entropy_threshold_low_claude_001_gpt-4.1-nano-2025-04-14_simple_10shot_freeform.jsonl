The generated rule, however, focuses on the input being a short, simple phrase—often an interjection or brief acknowledgment—and classifies longer, more complex sentences or proverbs as FALSE. While both rules tend to favor short, simple inputs, the ground truth emphasizes character-level predictability, whereas the generated rule emphasizes input length and type (interjection, phrase). They overlap somewhat in identifying simple, predictable texts but differ in the specific features they prioritize. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in their core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
