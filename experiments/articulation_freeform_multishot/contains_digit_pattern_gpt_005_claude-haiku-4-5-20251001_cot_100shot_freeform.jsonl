The generated rule, however, states that the input must match a pattern where a label (from a set like Code, Version, Number, or ID) is followed immediately by exactly three digits. While both rules involve the presence of three digits, the ground truth focuses solely on the presence of a sequence of three digits anywhere, regardless of context, whereas the generated rule requires a specific pattern with a label prefix. They share the core concept of identifying three consecutive digits, but the conditions differ significantly in scope and pattern specificity, leading to potential discrepancies in classification.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
