The generated rule broadens this by including URLs starting with \"http://\" or \"https://,\" which are common URL schemes, but also incorporates the words \"result\" or \"output\" as additional indicators for true cases. This means the generated rule considers more features and can classify some cases as true based on keywords rather than URLs alone. While both rules rely on the presence of URLs or specific keywords, the generated rule's inclusion of extra keywords and slightly different URL criteria means they are not perfectly aligned. They may produce similar results in many cases where URLs are the primary indicator, but they differ in scope and key features considered.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
