The ground truth specifies a sequence of three or more identical punctuation characters (e.g., '!!!', '???'), emphasizing a minimum length of three. The generated rule considers any repeated punctuation character appearing consecutively two or more times, which includes sequences of length two or more. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting repeated punctuation—is shared, the key difference lies in the minimum length threshold: the ground truth requires at least three in a row, whereas the generated rule flags sequences of two or more. This means the generated rule may classify texts with double punctuation (e.g., '!!') as positive, whereas the ground truth would classify them as negative. \n\nOverall, the core idea is similar, and they would produce the same classification in most cases involving three or more repetitions, but the difference in the minimum sequence length prevents perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
