In contrast, the generated rule classifies based on the presence of specific, concrete identifiers or references (like serial numbers, dates with times) versus general or vague information. While both rules relate to the presence of numerical or specific identifiable content, the ground truth emphasizes a ratio of digits to letters, whereas the generated rule emphasizes the presence of particular types of identifiable patterns. They do not identify the same key features or patterns and would likely produce different classifications on many inputs. The core concepts—numeric content ratio versus specific identifiable patterns—are different, making the rules largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
