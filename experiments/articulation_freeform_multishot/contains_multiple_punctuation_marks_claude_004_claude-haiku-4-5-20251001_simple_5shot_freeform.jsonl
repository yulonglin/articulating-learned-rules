It focuses on counting the total number of specific punctuation marks anywhere in the input. The Generated Rule states that the output is True when the input contains \"special characters\" (punctuation marks like `.`, `:`, `;`, `?`, `!`) \"interspersed within or between words,\" and False when only regular words and spaces are present, with punctuation only at the end if at all.  \n\nWhile both rules involve punctuation marks, the Ground Truth emphasizes the total count (three or more), regardless of position, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of punctuation within words or between words, implying a focus on punctuation placement rather than count. The Generated Rule's mention of \"interspersed\" suggests a different pattern than simply counting total punctuation marks.  \n\nThey are similar in that both consider certain punctuation marks and their presence, but they differ in the specific pattern and counting criteria. The Ground Truth is more about quantity, while the Generated Rule emphasizes the pattern of punctuation placement. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in core logic.  \n\nOverall, they would produce similar classifications in many cases, especially when multiple punctuation marks are present, but they are not perfectly aligned in their criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
