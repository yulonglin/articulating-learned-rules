It emphasizes the depth of nesting and the presence of quoted content within other quotes.\n\nThe generated rule, however, focuses on the content and context of quoted text, particularly whether the quoted phrase is a standalone word or part of a clear speech context, often associated with speech verbs. It also explicitly excludes certain single words not linked to speech.\n\nWhile both rules concern quoted text and its interpretation, they differ significantly in their core focus:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes structural nesting depth.  \n- The generated rule emphasizes the nature of the quoted content (whether it is a standalone speech phrase) and its contextual indicators.\n\nThey may overlap in cases where nested quotes imply speech, but they are not equivalent in their criteria. The generated rule is more content- and context-oriented, whereas the ground truth is structurally oriented. Therefore, they would not always produce the same classification, especially in cases where nesting depth and content/context diverge.\n\nOverall, they share some thematic elements but differ in key features and patterns, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
