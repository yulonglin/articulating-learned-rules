This captures a broad pattern of repeated characters anywhere in the text. The generated rule, however, only classifies a string as True if it contains the specific substring \"ssippi,\" which is a very narrow pattern and does not encompass all cases of repeated characters. While \"ssippi\" does contain consecutive 's's, the rule does not account for other repeated characters or patterns. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications will differ significantly on most inputs. The core concept of detecting repeated characters is only partially captured by the generated rule, making their equivalence minimal.","functional_test_accuracy":0.62,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":31,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.62},"parse_error":false}
