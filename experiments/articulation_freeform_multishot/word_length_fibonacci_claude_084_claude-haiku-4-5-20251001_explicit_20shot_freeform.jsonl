In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of at least three gibberish or non-dictionary words, regardless of their position or length. While both rules involve analyzing word features, they target fundamentally different aspects: one examines a numerical pattern in word lengths, the other assesses the nature of the words (meaningful vs. gibberish). They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, as they rely on different criteria. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their outputs would often diverge.","functional_test_accuracy":0.975,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":40,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":10,"accuracy":0.975},"parse_error":false}
