The Ground Truth explicitly states \"contains at least one word with a hyphen connecting two parts,\" while the Generated Rule describes \"a hyphenated word (a word with a hyphen connecting multiple parts).\" The core concept—detecting hyphenated words—is consistent. The only minor difference is the phrasing (\"with two parts\" vs. \"connecting multiple parts\"), but this does not change the fundamental pattern being identified. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same key feature and would produce the same classifications in most cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
