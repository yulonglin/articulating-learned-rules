This focuses solely on the distribution of word lengths within the text, regardless of content or specific phrases.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies based on the presence of a specific phrase (\"I am\") followed by two words that are both relatively long or complex, or otherwise short/simple words. It emphasizes particular patterns involving phrase structure and vocabulary complexity, not the overall distribution of word lengths.\n\nWhile both rules relate to word length and complexity, they do so in fundamentally different ways: one uses a statistical measure of length variability, the other uses pattern matching and vocabulary assessment. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially since the generated rule depends on specific phrases and vocabulary, whereas the ground truth depends solely on length variance.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their core concepts are only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
