In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of consecutive identical words, which is a different pattern entirely—repetition of specific words rather than uniformity in word length. These rules target different features and are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently. While both are criteria for classification, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their decision boundaries are largely independent. Therefore, they are only loosely related at best, resulting in a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
