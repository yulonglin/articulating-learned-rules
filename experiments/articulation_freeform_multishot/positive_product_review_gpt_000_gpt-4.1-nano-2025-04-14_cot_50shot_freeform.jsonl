The generated rule broadens this to include personal benefits, positive results, or subjective experiences related to health, convenience, or quality, which may or may not directly involve explicit positive sentiment about a product or service. While there is some overlap—both rules consider positive or beneficial aspects—they differ in scope and focus. The ground truth emphasizes sentiment about the product/service itself, whereas the generated rule emphasizes personal benefits and subjective experiences, potentially capturing a wider or different set of statements. Therefore, they share some key features but are not perfectly aligned, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
