The generated rule, however, requires two conditions: (1) the presence of at least one hyphenated word, and (2) the presence of at least one additional qualifying word from a specified set. This means the generated rule is more restrictive; it only labels texts as True if both conditions are met, whereas the ground truth labels any text with a hyphenated word regardless of other words. Therefore, while they share the core feature of hyphenated words, the generated rule introduces an additional requirement that can lead to different classifications, especially in cases where a hyphenated word appears without the qualifying set of words. Overall, they are similar in identifying hyphenated words but differ in their handling of additional context, making their equivalence partial at best.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
