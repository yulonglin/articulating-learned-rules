The Ground Truth explicitly states that the URL must start with 'http' or 'www', which aligns closely with the generated rule's mention of prefixes such as 'www.', 'http://', and 'https://'. The generated rule explicitly enumerates these patterns, making it clear what constitutes a URL, whereas the ground truth emphasizes the starting patterns.\n\nThe only minor difference is that the generated rule explicitly states \"at least one URL (website link)\" and provides examples, while the ground truth is slightly more restrictive in wording but effectively covers the same patterns.\n\nOverall, they identify the same key features and would produce nearly identical classifications on most inputs, with only a very slight potential for divergence if, for example, a URL pattern not explicitly listed in the generated rule (like 'ftp://') appears—though this is outside the scope of the current patterns.\n\nTherefore, they are functionally equivalent in intent and pattern recognition, warranting a high score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
