The generated rule, however, specifically focuses on positive emotions or joyful experiences, and classifies neutral, somber, or setting-related descriptions as false. While there is some overlap—both recognize emotional content—the generated rule narrows the scope to positive emotions only and explicitly excludes neutral or setting descriptions, which the ground truth does not specify. Therefore, they do not identify exactly the same features or patterns, and their classifications would differ in many cases involving negative emotions or neutral descriptions. The core concept of detecting emotional states is similar, but the emphasis and scope differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.74,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.74},"parse_error":false}
