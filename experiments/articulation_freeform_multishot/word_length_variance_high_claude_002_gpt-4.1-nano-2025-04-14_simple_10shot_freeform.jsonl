The generated rule, however, classifies texts as TRUE based solely on the presence of certain keywords related to understanding or sophistication, regardless of word length patterns. These rules focus on entirely different features—one on quantitative word length variability, the other on specific vocabulary presence. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent. Therefore, they are largely unrelated in logic and pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
