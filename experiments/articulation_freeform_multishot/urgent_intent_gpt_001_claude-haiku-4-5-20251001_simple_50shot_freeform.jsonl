The Ground Truth emphasizes a general indication of urgent requests or calls for immediate action, without specifying the context or severity. The Generated Rule explicitly includes life-threatening, safety-critical emergencies, and provides examples like medical crises, evacuations, hazardous situations, or security threats, which are subsets of urgent requests. \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying critical, urgent situations requiring prompt response. However, the Generated Rule explicitly excludes routine, polite, casual, or non-urgent messages, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly mention. This makes the Generated Rule slightly more specific and comprehensive in scope.\n\nOverall, they describe similar core concepts but differ slightly in scope and explicitness, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
