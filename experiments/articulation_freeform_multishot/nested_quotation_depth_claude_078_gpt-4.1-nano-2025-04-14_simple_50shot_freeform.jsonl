In contrast, the generated rule centers on detecting specific quoted phrases such as \"Never\" or \"Yes\" within reported speech or statements, especially when indicating reporting or hearing, without explicitly requiring nesting depth. While both rules involve quotations and reported speech, the ground truth emphasizes nesting depth, whereas the generated rule emphasizes particular content within quotations and contextual cues. They may overlap in some cases but generally target different features, leading to different classifications on many inputs. Therefore, they are not equivalent in key features, patterns, or core concepts.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
