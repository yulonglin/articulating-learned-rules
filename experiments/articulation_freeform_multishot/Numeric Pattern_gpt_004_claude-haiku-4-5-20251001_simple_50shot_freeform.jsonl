The generated rule, however, emphasizes dates associated with meetings, specifically in formats like \"Meeting on [Month] [Day], [Year]\" or \"Meeting on [Day]/[Month]/[Year]\", and also considers inputs that are just a single word without a date as negative. While both rules involve detecting dates, the generated rule narrows the context to meeting references and includes a specific example of date formats, whereas the ground truth rule broadly covers two date formats without contextual constraints. They do not fully align in key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on inputs that contain dates outside the specified meeting context or formats. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
