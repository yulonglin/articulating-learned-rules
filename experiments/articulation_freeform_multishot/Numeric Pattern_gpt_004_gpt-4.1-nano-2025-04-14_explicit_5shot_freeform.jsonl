The generated rule, however, specifies a very narrow pattern: dates only in the format \"Meeting on [Month] [Day], [Year]\" and only in that context. It does not account for other date formats or contexts, nor does it consider dates outside that specific phrase. Therefore, while both rules involve detecting dates, they do not identify the same key features or patterns comprehensively. They would produce similar classifications only in very limited cases matching the specific pattern, but generally, they are not equivalent in scope or concept.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
