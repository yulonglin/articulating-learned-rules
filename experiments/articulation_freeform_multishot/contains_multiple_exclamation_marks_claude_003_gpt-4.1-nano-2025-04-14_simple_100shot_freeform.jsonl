It focuses solely on the count of exclamation marks.\n\nThe generated rule classifies an input as True if there is at least one letter directly enclosed between two exclamation marks, emphasizing the presence of a \"highlighted\" letter within exclamation marks. This is a more specific pattern, requiring a letter between exclamation marks rather than just exclamation marks themselves.\n\nWhile both rules involve exclamation marks, they target different features: the ground truth counts total exclamation marks, whereas the generated rule looks for a specific pattern involving a letter between exclamation marks. They may produce similar classifications in some cases (e.g., inputs with multiple exclamation marks and highlighted letters), but they are not equivalent in core logic. The generated rule is more restrictive and conceptually different, leading to a moderate overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
