It explicitly targets these two patterns. The generated rule, however, broadly states that any date format (e.g., \"Month Day, Year\", \"M/D/YYYY\", \"D/M/YYYY\", etc.) indicates a positive, and anything without a date is negative. While both rules rely on detecting dates, the ground truth is more precise about which date formats qualify, whereas the generated rule is more general and inclusive of various formats. They would likely agree on many inputs containing the specified formats, but the generated rule might classify some inputs as positive that do not match the exact formats specified in the ground truth. Conversely, the ground truth might exclude certain date formats that the generated rule considers positive. Overall, they share the core concept of detecting dates but differ in specificity and scope, leading to a moderate level of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
