The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if there is at least one alphabetic word with embedded or adjacent punctuation, emphasizing the presence of punctuation within or next to words, and only requiring one such occurrence. These rules differ significantly in their key features: the ground truth emphasizes total punctuation count, while the generated rule emphasizes embedded or surrounding punctuation within words. They would rarely produce the same classification on most inputs, especially when the total punctuation count differs from the presence of embedded punctuation. The core concepts—punctuation count versus embedded punctuation—are not equivalent, leading to fundamentally different classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
