In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts as TRUE if there is at least one very long word (more than 10 characters), focusing on the presence of a single long word rather than the overall distribution. While both rules relate to word length, they target different aspects: the variance versus the existence of a long word. They may often agree when texts contain multiple long words or highly variable word lengths, but they can diverge in cases where the variance is high due to many moderately long words, yet no single word exceeds 10 characters, or vice versa. Therefore, they do not describe the same core pattern and are unlikely to produce identical classifications consistently.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
