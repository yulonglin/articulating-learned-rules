This encompasses a broad range of patterns, including strings with repeated characters, predictable sequences, or highly uniform distributions, regardless of whether the entire text is a single character or contains some variation.\n\nThe generated rule, however, specifically states that a text is TRUE only if it consists entirely of a single repeated character (case-insensitive), possibly with spaces or punctuation, and no other characters or words. This is a much narrower criterion, focusing solely on uniform repetition of a single character, rather than any low-entropy pattern that might include predictable but non-uniform distributions.\n\nWhile both rules tend to identify highly repetitive or predictable texts, the ground truth rule can classify texts with low entropy that are not strictly single-character repeats (e.g., \"aaaaaa\" vs. \"abababab\" which has higher entropy). Conversely, the generated rule excludes texts that are predictable but not composed solely of one repeated character.\n\nTherefore, they are related but not equivalent. The generated rule is a subset of the ground truth's broader low-entropy classification, making their core concepts similar but not identical.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
