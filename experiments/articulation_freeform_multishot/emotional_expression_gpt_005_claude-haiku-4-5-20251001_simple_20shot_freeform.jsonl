The Ground Truth emphasizes a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the presence of explicit emotional content. The Generated Rule specifies that the output is **True** when the input contains explicit emotional or affective language describing internal feelings, and **False** when describing physical scenes, objects, or actions without emotional content. \n\nWhile the phrasing differs—one emphasizes conveying a \"clear emotional state,\" and the other emphasizes \"explicit emotional or affective language\"—the core concept of detecting internal emotional states is consistent. Both rules exclude purely physical descriptions without emotional expression. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions affective language and internal feelings, which may slightly broaden or specify the scope compared to the Ground Truth, but overall, they align closely.\n\nThe slight difference in phrasing and emphasis accounts for a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
