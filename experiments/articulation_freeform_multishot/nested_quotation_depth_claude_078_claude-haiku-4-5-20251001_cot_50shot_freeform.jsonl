The Generated Rule states that the input contains nested quotations indicated by escaped quotes (`\\\"`), and distinguishes between only a single level of quotation and multiple levels.\n\nWhile both rules focus on nested quotations, the Ground Truth emphasizes the structural depth of nesting (minimum 2 levels), regardless of how quotes are represented, whereas the Generated Rule relies on the presence of escaped quotes to identify nesting. This means they generally align in identifying nested quotations, but the Ground Truth does not specify how nesting is marked, only that it exists at a certain depth, while the Generated Rule explicitly looks for escaped quotes as a marker.\n\nThey are similar in core concept—detecting nested quotations—but differ slightly in the specific features they consider (structural nesting vs. escaped quote markers). Therefore, they would produce similar classifications on most inputs involving nested quotes, but not perfectly aligned in all cases, especially if nesting is achieved without escape characters or if the nesting depth differs.\n\nOverall, they are closely related but not entirely equivalent in their criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
