The Generated Rule, however, centers on the presence of interactions, conflicts, or emotional/cognitive reactions of individuals versus purely descriptive observations of scenes or objects without human internal states or interpersonal elements. While both rules aim to distinguish between descriptions involving human internal or social elements and those that are purely observational, they differ in key features: the Ground Truth emphasizes perspective and pronoun usage, whereas the Generated Rule emphasizes the presence of interpersonal or internal human content. They overlap in identifying human-related content but differ in the specific features they prioritize, leading to partial but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
