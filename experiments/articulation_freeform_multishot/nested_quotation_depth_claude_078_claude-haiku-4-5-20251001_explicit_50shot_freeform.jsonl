The Ground Truth specifies nesting at least two levels deep (e.g., quotes within quotes), exemplified by phrases like 'He said \"She told me \\\"No\\\"\"', which involves multiple layers of quotes. The Generated Rule simplifies this to detecting the presence of escaped quotes `\\\"` within a quoted string, which generally indicates nesting or at least the presence of internal quotes.\n\nHowever, there are subtle differences:  \n- The Ground Truth emphasizes the depth of nesting (at least two levels), whereas the Generated Rule focuses on the presence of escaped quotes, which may or may not correspond exactly to nesting depth. For example, a single quoted phrase with an escaped quote (`\"He said \\\"Hello\\\"\"`), which the generated rule would classify as True, might not meet the ground truth's nesting depth criterion if it were part of a larger nested structure.  \n- Conversely, the ground truth's nesting requirement explicitly involves multiple layers, which may not always be captured solely by the presence of escaped quotes if the text contains only a single level of quotes with escaped characters.\n\nOverall, the core concept—detecting nested or internal quotation marks—is similar, but the specific criteria differ slightly in depth and pattern detection. The generated rule is a reasonable approximation but not perfectly aligned with the nesting depth requirement of the ground truth.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
