It focuses solely on **consecutive duplicate characters**.  \n\nThe generated rule states that the output is True if the word contains **at least one letter that appears two or more times**, whether **consecutively or non-consecutively** (e.g., 'aba' has 'a' twice non-consecutively). It labels words as True if there are **any duplicate letters**, regardless of their position or adjacency.\n\nBecause the ground truth only considers **consecutive duplicates**, and the generated rule considers **any duplicates**, they will **not** always agree. For example:  \n- Word: 'aba'  \n  - Ground truth: False (no consecutive duplicates)  \n  - Generated rule: True (has duplicate 'a')  \n\n- Word: 'book'  \n  - Both rules: True (has 'oo' as consecutive duplicate)  \n\n- Word: 'abcde'  \n  - Both rules: False (no duplicates)  \n\nOverall, the core concept differs: one focuses on **consecutive duplicates**, the other on **any duplicate**. They will produce the same classification only when duplicates are consecutive, but differ when duplicates are non-consecutive.  \n\nTherefore, they are **not** equivalent in logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
