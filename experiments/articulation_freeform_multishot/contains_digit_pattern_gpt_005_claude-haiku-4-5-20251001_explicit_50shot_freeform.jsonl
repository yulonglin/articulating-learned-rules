It focuses solely on the presence of a specific digit pattern.\n\nThe generated rule, however, classifies inputs based on specific prefixes (\"Version\", \"Number\", \"Code:\", \"ID:\") and whether the number following these prefixes is ≥ 100. It explicitly excludes \"Serial\" entries and considers the prefix and numeric threshold as key features.\n\nThese rules are fundamentally different in their core logic:  \n- The ground truth is pattern-based, centered on digit sequences.  \n- The generated rule is prefix- and number-based, with a threshold condition.\n\nThey would rarely produce the same classification for the same input, especially since the ground truth does not consider prefixes or numeric thresholds, only the presence of three consecutive digits. Therefore, their core concepts and key features are not aligned, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
