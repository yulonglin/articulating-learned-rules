The ground truth rule emphasizes that *all* alphabetic characters in the input are uppercase and that there is at least one letter. The generated rule states that *all words* are in uppercase, which implies that every word must be entirely uppercase, including all alphabetic characters within each word.  \n\nKey similarities:  \n- Both rules require at least one letter.  \n- Both require all alphabetic characters to be uppercase.  \n\nKey differences:  \n- The ground truth rule considers individual alphabetic characters anywhere in the input, regardless of word boundaries.  \n- The generated rule considers entire words, requiring each word to be fully uppercase, which is a slightly stronger condition if words contain non-alphabetic characters or mixed case.  \n\nIn most typical cases (e.g., a string of uppercase words), they will produce the same classification. However, if the input contains mixed-case words or non-alphabetic characters within words, the generated rule might classify differently from the ground truth.  \n\nOverall, they are very similar in intent and outcome, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, preventing a perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
