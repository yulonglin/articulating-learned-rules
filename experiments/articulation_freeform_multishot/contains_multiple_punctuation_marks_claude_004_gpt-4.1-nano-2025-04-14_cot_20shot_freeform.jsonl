In contrast, the Generated rule classifies an input as True if it contains at least one word with internal punctuation, emphasizing the presence of punctuated words rather than total punctuation count. While both rules relate to punctuation, they target different features: total punctuation marks versus internal punctuation within words. They may produce similar classifications in some cases (e.g., texts with multiple punctuation marks often contain punctuated words), but they are not equivalent in logic or pattern detection. Therefore, they are only partially aligned and do not describe the same classification criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
