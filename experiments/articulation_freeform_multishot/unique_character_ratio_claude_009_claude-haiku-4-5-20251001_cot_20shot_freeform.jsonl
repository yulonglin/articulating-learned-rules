The generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it contains a repeated sequence (word or character) at least 3 times, focusing on repeated patterns or sequences. While both rules relate to repetition, the ground truth emphasizes overall character diversity, whereas the generated rule targets specific repeated sequences. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., highly repetitive text), but they do not fundamentally identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are not equivalent and would likely produce different classifications on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
