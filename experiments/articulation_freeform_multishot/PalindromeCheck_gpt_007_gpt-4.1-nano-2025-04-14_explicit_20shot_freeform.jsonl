The Ground Truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the Generated Rule extends this to ignore punctuation as well. This extension makes the Generated Rule slightly more inclusive, but the core concept—checking for palindromes under normalization—is essentially the same. They would produce identical classifications on most inputs that contain only spaces, case differences, and punctuation, but the Generated Rule is marginally more comprehensive. Overall, the core logic aligns closely, making them effectively equivalent in intent and application, with a minor difference in the scope of ignored characters.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
