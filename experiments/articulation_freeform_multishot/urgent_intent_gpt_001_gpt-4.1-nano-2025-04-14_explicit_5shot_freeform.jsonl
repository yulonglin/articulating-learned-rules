The Ground Truth emphasizes an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" focusing on the presence of urgent language or requests. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"urgent, critical, or emergency-related language\" indicating a need for immediate action, which aligns closely with the original intent. They both target similar key features—urgent or emergency language prompting immediate response. However, the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"critical\" and \"emergency-related\" terms, which may slightly expand or differ from the original phrasing. Overall, they describe very similar concepts and would likely produce similar classifications, but the slight difference in phrasing and scope accounts for a near-perfect score rather than a perfect one.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
