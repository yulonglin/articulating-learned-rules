In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of nonsensical or gibberish words, regardless of their length or other features. These are fundamentally different features: one is about a precise length pattern, the other about the nature of the words' content. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classification on the same input. While both rules relate to word characteristics, their core concepts are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
