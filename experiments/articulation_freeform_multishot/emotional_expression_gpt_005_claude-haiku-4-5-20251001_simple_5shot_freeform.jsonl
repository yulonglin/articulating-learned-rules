The Generated Rule, however, classifies inputs based on whether they describe internal emotional or psychological states versus external sensory perceptions or physical events, which is a broader distinction. While there is some overlap—both rules consider internal emotional states—the Generated Rule explicitly excludes external sensory descriptions and physical actions, which the Ground Truth does not explicitly address. As a result, they may diverge in classification when the input involves external sensory details that do not directly convey an emotional state. Overall, they share a core focus on internal emotional states but differ in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
