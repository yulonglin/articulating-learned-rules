It focuses on specific, well-defined date formats. The generated rule, however, broadly states that the input contains a date in various formats, including \"Meeting on\" followed by a month and day or numeric dates, and associates this with scheduled meetings. While both rules involve detecting dates, the generated rule emphasizes contextual cues (\"Meeting on\") and a wider range of date formats, not limited to the specific formats in the ground truth. They share the core concept of identifying dates, but the scope and specificity differ, leading to potential discrepancies in classification. Therefore, they are related but not perfectly aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
