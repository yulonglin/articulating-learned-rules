The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit mentions of negative opinions. The Generated Rule broadly captures negative experiences or complaints, which generally align with dissatisfaction or criticism. However, the Generated Rule's phrasing (\"describes a negative experience or complaint\") is slightly more general and may include some inputs that are negative but not explicitly critical, or exclude subtle criticisms that don't clearly describe a negative experience. Overall, they share the core concept of identifying negative evaluations, but the phrasing differences and potential scope variations prevent a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
