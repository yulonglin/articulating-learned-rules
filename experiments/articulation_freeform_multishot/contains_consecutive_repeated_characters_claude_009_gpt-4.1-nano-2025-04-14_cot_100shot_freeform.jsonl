The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if any character appears two or more times consecutively (e.g., 'oo', 'ss'), focusing on immediate adjacency. The Generated Rule states that a word is True if it contains at least one letter that appears more than once, regardless of whether the repetitions are consecutive or not. \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting repeated characters—is similar, the key difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes consecutive repetitions, whereas the Generated Rule considers any repeated character anywhere in the string, including non-consecutive repetitions. \n\nIn most cases, these rules will produce the same classification, especially for strings with consecutive repeated characters. However, they may differ in cases where characters are repeated non-consecutively (e.g., 'a...a' with other characters in between). \n\nTherefore, they are closely aligned in intent but not perfectly equivalent, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
