The generated rule, however, specifically identifies only texts composed entirely of a single repeated character (case-insensitive), with no other characters or words. While both rules tend to identify highly repetitive texts, the ground truth rule is broader, allowing for some variation as long as the overall character diversity remains low, whereas the generated rule is more restrictive, focusing solely on uniform single-character strings. Therefore, they share some conceptual similarity regarding repetition but differ significantly in scope and specificity, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.52,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":26,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.52},"parse_error":false}
