The generated rule only classifies words as True if they are anagrams of \"listen,\" ignoring \"below\" and \"study.\" While both rules rely on the concept of anagrams, the ground truth encompasses multiple target words, whereas the generated rule focuses solely on one. Therefore, they share the core concept of identifying anagrams but differ significantly in scope and key features, leading to different classifications for many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
