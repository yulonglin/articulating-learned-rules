It does not consider vocabulary complexity, repetition, or length directly, but rather the distribution of word lengths.\n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on lexical features such as the presence of repeated common words, the simplicity of vocabulary, and overall text length. It emphasizes vocabulary familiarity and repetition patterns rather than quantitative word length metrics.\n\nWhile both rules may sometimes coincide—e.g., texts with uniform word lengths might also contain repeated simple words—they fundamentally target different features: one statistical (variance of word lengths) and the other lexical and structural (word repetition, vocabulary complexity, length). Therefore, they do not identify the same patterns and are unlikely to produce identical classifications across diverse inputs.\n\nOverall, the core concepts differ significantly, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
