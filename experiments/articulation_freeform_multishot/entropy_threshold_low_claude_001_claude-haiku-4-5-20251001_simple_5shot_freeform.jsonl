The generated rule, however, focuses specifically on the repetition of the same word or phrase versus the presence of unique proverbs or sayings with distinct words. While both rules relate to repetition and predictability, they target different aspects: the ground truth emphasizes character-level entropy, whereas the generated rule emphasizes word-level repetition and diversity. Consequently, they may overlap in some cases (e.g., repetitive phrases tend to have low entropy), but they are not equivalent in scope or core concept. They would not necessarily produce identical classifications across all inputs, especially those with complex or varied structures.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
