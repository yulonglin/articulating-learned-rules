The generated rule, however, specifies that True is only when there is at least one exclamation mark *inside* the string, specifically one that appears between two words (i.e., surrounded by alphabetic characters). It also considers the absence of such internal exclamation marks or the presence of exclamation marks only at the start or end as False.\n\nWhile both rules involve exclamation marks, their key features differ:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes the total count of exclamation marks (≥2).  \n- The generated rule emphasizes the position of at least one exclamation mark (internal, between words).\n\nThey do not identify the same patterns: the ground truth can classify strings with multiple exclamation marks at the start or end as True, even if none are internal, whereas the generated rule would classify such strings as False unless an internal exclamation mark exists.\n\nOn most inputs, especially those with multiple exclamation marks, the classifications may often differ because the criteria are based on different features (count vs. position). The core concept—presence of exclamation marks—is shared, but the specific conditions differ significantly.\n\nTherefore, the two rules are related but not equivalent in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
