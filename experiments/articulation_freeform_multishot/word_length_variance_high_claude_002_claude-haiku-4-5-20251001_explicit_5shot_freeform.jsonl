This focuses solely on the distribution of word lengths, regardless of the actual words or their initial letters. \n\nIn contrast, the generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of at least two content words sharing the same initial letter, excluding function words. This centers on the initial letter pattern among content words, not on word length variability.\n\nThese rules target fundamentally different features: one on length distribution, the other on initial letter patterns. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications across most inputs, as a text could have high length variance without any repeated initial letters among content words, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to agree on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent.\n\nOverall, the similarity score is very low, reflecting their distinct classification criteria.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
