The generated rule, however, specifies that a word must be an anagram of only \"listen,\" focusing on a single specific word. While \"listen\" is included in the ground truth set, the ground truth encompasses additional words (\"below,\" \"study\") that are not captured by the generated rule. Therefore, the core concept of identifying anagrams is shared, but the scope differs significantly. The generated rule is narrower and does not account for the other common words, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
