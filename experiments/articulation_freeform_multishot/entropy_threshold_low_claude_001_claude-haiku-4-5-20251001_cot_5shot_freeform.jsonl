In contrast, the generated rule excludes recognized proverbs, idioms, or famous sayings, which are specific, high-level semantic categories. While both rules aim to distinguish \"predictable\" or \"familiar\" text from \"less predictable\" or \"arbitrary\" text, they do so via fundamentally different criteria: one via statistical character entropy, the other via semantic recognition of known sayings. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., very repetitive text might not be a proverb), but they do not identify the same key features or patterns. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce identical classifications across most inputs, and their core concepts are only loosely related.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
