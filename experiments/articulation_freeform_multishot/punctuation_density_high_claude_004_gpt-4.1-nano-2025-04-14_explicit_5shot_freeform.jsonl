The generated rule centers on the presence of specific expressive words or phrases conveying surprise, doubt, or questioning, which are qualitative indicators of reaction or doubt. These rules target different features: one measures punctuation density, the other detects particular expressions. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, as texts with heavy punctuation may not contain the specified expressions, and texts with those expressions may not have high punctuation density. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features, are unlikely to produce identical classifications, and are not core conceptually equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
