The Ground Truth specifies \"letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase,\" which is a stricter pattern, but in practice, this often aligns with words that contain both uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., \"aBcDeF\"). The Generated Rule states that a word must have both uppercase and lowercase letters to be considered a match, which captures the core concept of mixed case within a word.\n\nThe main difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes an alternating pattern, which is a subset of words that contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, but not all words with mixed case necessarily alternate strictly. Conversely, the generated rule considers any word with at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter, regardless of the pattern.\n\nDespite this subtle difference, in typical usage, both rules will classify the same set of words as \"mixed case\" in most cases, leading to very similar overall classifications. Therefore, they are functionally equivalent in most practical scenarios, just with a slight difference in the strictness of the pattern.\n\nOverall, the core concept—detecting words with both uppercase and lowercase letters—is the same, making the rules effectively equivalent for classification purposes.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
