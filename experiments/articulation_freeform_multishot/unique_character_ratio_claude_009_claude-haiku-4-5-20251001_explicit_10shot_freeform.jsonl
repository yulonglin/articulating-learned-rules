This captures a broad pattern: any text with limited character diversity, including repeated characters, repeated words, or simple patterns, will be classified as TRUE.\n\nThe generated rule specifically identifies texts that are composed of a single letter repeated multiple times (with spaces), and excludes texts containing actual words or multiple different letters. It focuses narrowly on a particular pattern—repetitive single-letter sequences—rather than the broader concept of character variety.\n\nWhile both rules tend to classify highly repetitive or low-diversity texts as TRUE, the ground truth rule can also classify texts with repeated words or limited character sets that are not strictly single-letter repetitions. Conversely, the generated rule excludes texts with meaningful words or multiple different characters, even if their overall character variety is low.\n\nTherefore, they share some conceptual overlap—both recognize repetition or limited diversity as indicative of TRUE—but they are not fully aligned in scope or pattern detection. The generated rule is more specific, while the ground truth rule is more general.\n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
