The Ground Truth specifies topics like finance, money, banking, or investments, focusing on the subject matter. The Generated Rule broadens this to include financial, economic, investment, or banking concepts, principles, and practices, which aligns closely with the original focus but adds the aspect of \"principles and practices,\" slightly expanding the scope. Both rules identify similar key features—financial and economic content—and would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs. However, the generated rule's inclusion of \"economic\" and \"principles and practices\" introduces minor differences in phrasing and scope, preventing a perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
