The Ground Truth emphasizes a positive sentiment specifically about a product or service, while the Generated Rule frames it as satisfaction with something that solves a problem or improves life, which is a broader but related concept. They largely overlap in capturing positive opinions about tangible or functional benefits. However, the Generated Rule introduces the idea of problem-solving or life improvement, which may include sentiments not explicitly about a product or service (e.g., general satisfaction), and might exclude some positive sentiments strictly about a product or service without emphasizing problem-solving. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
