The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an \"urgent request or call for immediate action,\" which captures the core concept of urgency and immediacy. The Generated Rule explicitly lists specific keywords and phrases associated with urgent, time-sensitive, or emergency situations, providing a detailed pattern-matching approach.\n\nThey largely overlap in identifying urgent, emergency-related calls to action. However, the Ground Truth is more abstract, focusing on the general idea of urgency, while the Generated Rule specifies particular words and phrases, potentially capturing more nuanced cases or missing some that imply urgency without explicit keywords.\n\nOverall, they describe the same core concept—urgent, immediate action—but differ slightly in their approach: one is conceptual, the other more pattern-based. This results in a high degree of equivalence but not perfect, hence a score of 8.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
