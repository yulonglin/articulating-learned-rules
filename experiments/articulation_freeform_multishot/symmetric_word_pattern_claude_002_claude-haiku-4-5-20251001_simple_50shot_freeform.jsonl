The generated rule, however, requires two conditions: (1) at least one palindromic word, and (2) at least one additional word from a specific set of allowed words. This additional requirement significantly narrows the classification criteria compared to the ground truth. While both rules hinge on the presence of a palindromic word, the generated rule introduces an extra condition that may exclude texts containing only a palindrome word and no other allowed words. Therefore, they share the core concept of identifying palindromic words but differ in the overall classification logic, making them only partially aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
