The ground truth specifies a pattern where a digit is directly flanked by letters (e.g., 'a5b'), emphasizing the digit's position between two letters. The generated rule states that a word contains a lowercase letter directly followed by a digit, which captures a similar pattern but is slightly narrower, as it only considers the \"letter-digit\" sequence within words, not necessarily the \"letter-digit-letter\" pattern.  \n\nThey generally identify similar key features—digits adjacent to lowercase letters—but differ in scope: the ground truth emphasizes a digit surrounded by letters, while the generated rule focuses on a lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit within a word. This means they would produce similar classifications in many cases but may diverge in edge cases where the pattern differs slightly. Overall, the core concept of adjacency between lowercase letters and digits is aligned, but the specific pattern matching differs somewhat.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
