The generated rule, however, specifies that the input must contain a date in \"Meeting on [Month Day, Year]\" or \"Meeting on [Day/Month/Year]\" formats, and additionally considers whether the input is a single word without a date. While both rules rely on the presence of a date, their key features differ: the ground truth emphasizes particular date formats, whereas the generated rule emphasizes specific contextual phrases (\"Meeting on\") and broader date formats (\"Day/Month/Year\"). They would often agree when the input contains the specified date formats, but the generated rule introduces additional contextual constraints and different date formats, leading to potential discrepancies. Therefore, they are related but not fully equivalent in their classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
