The Ground Truth emphasizes the perspective (first-person) and personal experiences, feelings, or actions. The Generated rule similarly highlights personal experiences, feelings, or reflections involving \"I,\" \"we,\" \"my,\" etc., and explicitly mentions introspection, creativity, and personal growth. \n\nHowever, the Generated rule explicitly states that it outputs **False** for external observations, factual statements, or third-party events, which aligns with the Ground Truth's focus on first-person perspective but is slightly more explicit about excluding external, non-internal content. The Ground Truth implicitly assumes the perspective-based criterion, while the Generated rule explicitly states the types of content that qualify or disqualify.\n\nOverall, the core concept—identifying subjective, personal, or introspective content involving the speaker—is well aligned, but the phrasing and explicitness differ slightly, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
