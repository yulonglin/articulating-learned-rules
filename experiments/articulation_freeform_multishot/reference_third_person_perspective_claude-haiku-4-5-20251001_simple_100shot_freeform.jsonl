The Ground Truth emphasizes third-person perspective (he, she, they, them), which directly targets the subject focus, while the Generated Rule centers on the type of content—actions, decisions, emotions, or characteristics versus environmental descriptions. They overlap in identifying sentences about people’s internal states or actions as positive, and environmental descriptions as negative. However, the Ground Truth’s focus on perspective may capture nuances (e.g., sentences about people not explicitly using third-person pronouns might be misclassified), whereas the Generated Rule relies solely on content type. Overall, they share core concepts but differ slightly in approach, leading to a high but not perfect alignment.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
