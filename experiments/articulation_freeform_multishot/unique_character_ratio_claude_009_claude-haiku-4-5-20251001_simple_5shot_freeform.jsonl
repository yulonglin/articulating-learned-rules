The Generated Rule, however, specifically identifies inputs composed of repeated single-letter groups (e.g., \"ww ww w\") as TRUE, and explicitly excludes normal words or sentences with punctuation. While both rules focus on character repetition, the Ground Truth rule is more general, relying on a quantitative ratio, whereas the Generated Rule is more prescriptive about the pattern (repeated single-letter groups). They may agree on some highly repetitive inputs but differ significantly on more complex or varied texts. Overall, they do not fully align in identifying the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would diverge on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.66,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":33,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.66},"parse_error":false}
