The Ground Truth explicitly states that the digit must have a letter immediately before and after it, which aligns closely with the Generated Rule's pattern of a letter-digit-letter sequence. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule's phrasing (\"the output is True when the input contains a pattern of a letter followed by a digit followed by another letter\") is slightly more specific and may exclude some cases where the digit is preceded or followed by non-letter characters, whereas the Ground Truth emphasizes the immediate adjacency of letters around the digit without specifying the nature of other surrounding characters.\n\nDespite this subtle difference, in most typical scenarios, both rules would classify inputs similarly, especially when the pattern is clearly embedded as a letter-digit-letter sequence. Therefore, they are largely equivalent in intent and practical application, but not perfectly identical in phrasing or potential edge cases.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
