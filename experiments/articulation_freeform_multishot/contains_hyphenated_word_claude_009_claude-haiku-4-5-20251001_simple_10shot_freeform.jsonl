The Generated Rule also considers hyphenated words as a criterion but adds an additional condition: if no hyphenated words are present, it still outputs True if at least two of the specific words (\"python\", \"check\", \"value\", \"testing\", \"over\", \"sat\") are present. This means the generated rule can produce True in cases where the ground truth rule would produce False (e.g., input without hyphenated words but with at least two of the specified words). Conversely, both rules agree when a hyphenated word is present. Therefore, they are similar but not equivalent; the generated rule introduces an alternative pathway to True that the ground truth rule does not account for.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
