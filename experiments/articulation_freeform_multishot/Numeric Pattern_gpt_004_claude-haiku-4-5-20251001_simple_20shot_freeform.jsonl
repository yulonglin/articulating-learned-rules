The generated rule broadens this by including \"various formats like 'D/M/YYYY'\" and considers any date presence as positive, regardless of specific format, and also explicitly states that a single word without a date is negative. While both rules rely on detecting dates, the generated rule is more inclusive of formats and less precise about which date formats qualify. They generally agree on inputs containing the specified date formats, but the generated rule might classify some inputs as positive that the ground truth would not (e.g., dates in other formats not explicitly mentioned). Conversely, the core concept of identifying dates as the key feature is shared, but the scope and specificity differ. Therefore, they are similar but not perfectly aligned.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
