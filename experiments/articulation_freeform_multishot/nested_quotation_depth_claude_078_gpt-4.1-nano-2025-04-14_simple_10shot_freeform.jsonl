In contrast, the generated rule targets the presence of specific quoted words (\"Stop\" or \"Yes\") that are case-sensitive, with no mention of nesting or structural complexity. They do not identify the same key features or patterns; the ground truth emphasizes nested quotations regardless of content, while the generated rule is about specific quoted words without regard to nesting. Consequently, they would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts—structural nesting versus specific quoted content—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.72,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":36,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.72},"parse_error":false}
