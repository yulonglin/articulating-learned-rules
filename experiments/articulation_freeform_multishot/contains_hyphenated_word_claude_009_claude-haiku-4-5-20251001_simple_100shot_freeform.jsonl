It relies solely on the presence of hyphenated words as the key feature.  \n\nThe Generated Rule, however, requires two conditions:  \n1. The presence of at least one hyphenated word (similar to the ground truth).  \n2. The presence of at least one \"positive\" word from a specific set.  \n\nThis additional requirement means that the generated rule is more restrictive: it only labels inputs as True if both conditions are met. As a result, many inputs containing hyphenated words but lacking any of the specified positive words would be classified as False under the generated rule, whereas the ground truth would classify them as True. Conversely, if an input contains a hyphenated word and a positive word, both rules agree.  \n\nTherefore, while the core feature (hyphenated words) is common, the generated rule introduces an extra layer that changes the classification logic, making the two rules not equivalent. They share some key features but do not produce the same classifications in general.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
