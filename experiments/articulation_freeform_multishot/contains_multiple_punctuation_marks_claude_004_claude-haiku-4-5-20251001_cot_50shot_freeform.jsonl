It focuses solely on the count and presence of these punctuation marks anywhere in the input.\n\nThe Generated rule, however, specifies that the input should be classified as True if it contains certain punctuation marks (!, ?, ;, ,, .) that appear within or between words, explicitly excluding punctuation only at the end of the string. It emphasizes the position of punctuation (not just presence) and includes a different set of punctuation marks (notably including comma and period, which are not in the Ground Truth set).\n\nBecause of these differences:\n- The sets of punctuation considered are not identical.\n- The position requirement (within or between words vs. anywhere) is a significant divergence.\n- The count threshold (three or more) in the Ground Truth is not explicitly mirrored in the Generated rule.\n\nWhile there is some overlap in the types of punctuation considered, the core concepts—count-based threshold vs. positional context and differing punctuation sets—are not equivalent. Therefore, they would not produce the same classifications in all cases, and their core logic differs substantially.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
