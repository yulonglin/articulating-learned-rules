The Generated rule, however, classifies sentences based on the presence of verbs indicating mental, disagreement, or cognitive processes versus sensory or passive observations, which is a semantic and content-based criterion.  \n\nWhile both rules aim to distinguish certain types of sentences, they focus on different features: one on perspective and pronoun usage, the other on verb semantics related to mental versus sensory content. They may sometimes align—e.g., sentences with third-person perspective often contain mental or cognitive verbs—but they are not inherently equivalent. The generated rule could classify sentences differently based on verb content regardless of perspective, and vice versa.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would not always match.
