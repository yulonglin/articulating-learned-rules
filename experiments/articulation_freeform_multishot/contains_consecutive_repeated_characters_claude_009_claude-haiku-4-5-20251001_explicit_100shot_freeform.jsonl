The Ground Truth rule classifies a word as True if any character appears two or more times consecutively, emphasizing immediate adjacency. The Generated Rule broadens this by classifying a word as True if it contains any letter that appears multiple times, regardless of whether the repetitions are consecutive or not.  \n\nWhile the core concept—detecting repeated characters—is shared, the generated rule considers non-consecutive duplicates, whereas the ground truth emphasizes consecutive duplicates. In most cases, these rules will agree, especially for words with consecutive repeats. However, they differ in edge cases where repeated characters are non-consecutive (e.g., \"data\" with two 'a's), leading to potential classification discrepancies.  \n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in intent but differ slightly in scope, resulting in a high but not perfect equivalence score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8604651162790697,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":43,"n_correct":37,"n_skipped":7,"accuracy":0.8604651162790697},"parse_error":false}
