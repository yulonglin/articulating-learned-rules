In contrast, the generated rule classifies texts solely based on the presence of at least one very long word (longer than 10 characters), which is a much narrower criterion. They do not identify the same key features or patterns: the ground truth considers the overall variability, while the generated rule focuses on a single word length threshold. Consequently, they are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially in cases where the variance is high but no individual word exceeds 10 characters, or vice versa. The core concepts differ significantly, making these rules not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.78,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":39,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.78},"parse_error":false}
