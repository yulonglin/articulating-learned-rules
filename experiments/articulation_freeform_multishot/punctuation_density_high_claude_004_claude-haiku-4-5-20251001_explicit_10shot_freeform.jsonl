It focuses on a measurable, aggregate property of the text.\n\nThe generated rule, however, emphasizes the presence of multiple or non-standard punctuation patterns (e.g., ellipses, multiple exclamation or question marks) that convey specific expressive intents like uncertainty, excitement, or emphasis. It distinguishes between \"non-standard/emphatic\" and \"standard\" punctuation usage, relying on pattern recognition rather than a strict percentage threshold.\n\nWhile both rules relate to punctuation density or pattern, they differ significantly in their core criteria: one is quantitative (percentage-based), the other qualitative (pattern-based). They may overlap in some cases—texts with heavy punctuation are likely to have multiple or non-standard punctuation marks—but they are not equivalent in scope or approach.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their classifications may diverge on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
