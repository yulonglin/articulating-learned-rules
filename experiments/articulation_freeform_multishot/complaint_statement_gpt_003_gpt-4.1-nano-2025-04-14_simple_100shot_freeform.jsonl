The Ground Truth emphasizes explicit statements of dissatisfaction or criticism, while the Generated Rule broadens this to include highlighting negative experiences, problems, or poor quality, and explicitly states that positive or neutral reviews are not included. They largely overlap in identifying negative reviews, but the Generated Rule's phrasing (\"indicating problems or poor quality\") may encompass some nuances not explicitly captured by the Ground Truth's focus on explicit dissatisfaction. Overall, they are very similar in core concept but differ slightly in phrasing and scope, leading to a high but not perfect equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
