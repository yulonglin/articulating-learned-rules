The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True only if it contains at least one word with an embedded exclamation mark, focusing on the presence of special characters within words rather than counting total exclamation marks. This means the generated rule may miss inputs with multiple exclamation marks spread across different words or in the text outside of words, and it may incorrectly classify inputs with a single embedded exclamation mark as True, even if the total number of exclamation marks is less than two. Therefore, while both rules involve exclamation marks, their key features and resulting classifications differ significantly, leading to only a partial overlap in logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
