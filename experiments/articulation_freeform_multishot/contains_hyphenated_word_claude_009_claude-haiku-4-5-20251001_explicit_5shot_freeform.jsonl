The generated rule, however, classifies a text as True if it contains at least two words from a specific set, which includes \"well-known\" among other words like \"value,\" \"python,\" \"testing,\" etc. While \"well-known\" is part of the set, the rule's core criterion is the count of set words, not the hyphenation pattern itself.  \n\nThe two rules are related in that \"well-known\" is a hyphenated word and is included in the set, but the generated rule's reliance on multiple set words does not directly capture the hyphenation pattern. It may classify texts with multiple set words as True regardless of hyphenation, and texts with a single hyphenated word but no other set words as False.  \n\nTherefore, they share some overlap when \"well-known\" appears and the count threshold is met, but overall, they do not identify the same key feature or pattern, nor do they produce identical classifications across all inputs. The core concept of hyphenation versus multiple specific words differs significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":0.4897959183673469,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":24,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.4897959183673469},"parse_error":false}
