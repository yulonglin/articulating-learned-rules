The generated rule classifies texts based on the presence of nonsensical or random-looking words versus common English words, which is a different feature altogether. While both rules aim to categorize text, they rely on fundamentally different criteria—one on numerical word length patterns, the other on the nature of the words' content. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, and their core concepts are not equivalent. Therefore, the two rules are only loosely related at best, resulting in a low score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
