It clearly identifies the presence of these exact patterns as the basis for classification. The generated rule, however, broadly mentions \"a meeting date with a valid date format (numeric or month name)\" without specifying the exact formats, and introduces the concept of a \"meeting\" which is not present in the ground truth. While both rules focus on detecting date mentions, the generated rule is more general and less precise, potentially capturing more or different patterns. They share the core concept of identifying date mentions, but differ significantly in the specific patterns and context considered. Therefore, they are somewhat aligned but not equivalent, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
