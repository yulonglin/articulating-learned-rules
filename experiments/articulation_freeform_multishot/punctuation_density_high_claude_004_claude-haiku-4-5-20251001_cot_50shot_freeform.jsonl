That's so cool!!!\", \"Are you sure???!!!\"\n\n**False cases tend to have:**\n- Single or simple punctuation\n- Standard sentence structure\n- Even if excited, they use only one exclamation mark\n- Examples: \"Wow! That's incredible!\", \"Congratulations! You've done it!\", \"Hello!

In contrast, the generated rule centers on the presence of specific punctuation patterns (multiple marks in close proximity, repeated punctuation, or combined punctuation like ellipses with question/exclamation marks) to suggest emotional intensity or emphasis. While both rules relate to punctuation, the ground truth emphasizes overall quantity, whereas the generated rule emphasizes particular patterns indicative of emotional or emphatic speech. They may overlap in some cases (e.g., heavy punctuation often involves multiple marks), but they are based on different core features and would likely produce different classifications in many scenarios.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
