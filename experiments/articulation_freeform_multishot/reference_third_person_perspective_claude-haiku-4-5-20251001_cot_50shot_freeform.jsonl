The Ground Truth emphasizes third-person perspective and human-centric descriptions, while the Generated rule broadly characterizes true cases as involving people performing actions, emotions, or traits, and false cases as scenes or sensory experiences without human focus. They largely overlap in identifying human agency as key, but the Ground Truth specifies perspective (third-person) and may implicitly include narrative context, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes actions, emotions, and traits more explicitly. Therefore, they are similar in core concept but differ slightly in phrasing and emphasis, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
