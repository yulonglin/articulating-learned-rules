Tell me more.\" - straightforward question\n- \"She said, 'Yes!!!' with excitement.\" - exclamation but in narrative context\n- \"Oops! I did it again.\" - single exclamation, clear statement\n- \"Hey! Don't forget this.\" - imperative with one exclamation\n- \"Absolutely, let's go!\" - enthusiastic but direct\n- \"Wow, I can't believe it!\" - single exclamation\n- \"Hello! How are you today?\" - greeting with question\n- \"Wow! That's incredible!\" - single exclamation\n- \"Seriously? You can't be serious.\" - rhetorical but clear\n\n**True cases:**\n- \"She said, 'Yes!!!' with excitement.\" - Wait, this is marked True, let me reconsider\n- \"Wow!!! That's so cool!!!\" - multiple exclamation marks\n- \"Wait! Hold on... just a second.\" - ellipsis + exclamation combination\n- \"Hmm... I suppose so...??\" - ellipsis + multiple punctuation marks\n- \"Wait... what?! I can't believe it; this is crazy!!!\" - mixed punctuation (ellipsis, ?!, !!!)\n- \"Hmm... I think so... yeah?\" - ellipsis + question mark\n- \"What?! Are you kidding?!\" - ?! combination\n- \"Wait... what? Are you serious?!\" - ellipsis + ?!\n- \"That's amazing... isn't it?!\" - ellipsis + ?!\n- \"Hey... check this out!!!\" - ellipsis + multiple !!!\n\n**Pattern:** True cases contain **ellipsis (...) combined with other punctuation marks** (especially ?! or multiple !) or **multiple consecutive punctuation marks** (?! or !!!), suggesting hesitation, uncertainty, or mixed emotions. False cases use single, straightforward punctuation.\n\n**Rule:** The classification is True when the text contains ellipsis combined with other punctuation marks (like ?! or !!!), or uses unconventional punctuation combinations that suggest hesitation, uncertainty","keyword_match_score":0.25,"rouge_l_score":0.22727272727272727,"llm_judge_score":0.4,"llm_judge_reasoning":"The ground truth rule classifies text as TRUE based on a quantitative measure—punctuation marks exceeding 15% of total characters—focusing on the overall proportion of punctuation. The generated rule, however, emphasizes specific punctuation patterns (ellipsis combined with other marks, or unconventional combinations indicating hesitation or uncertainty), which is a qualitative pattern recognition. While both rules relate to punctuation, they target different aspects: one measures overall punctuation density, the other looks for particular punctuation sequences. They may overlap in some cases (texts with heavy punctuation often contain such patterns), but they are not equivalent in core logic. Therefore, they are only partially aligned, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.76,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":38,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.76},"parse_error":false}
