This focuses specifically on the presence of a sequence of three identical digits in a row.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, labels inputs as True if they contain at least one repeated digit (e.g., \"383\", \"333\") or if the number has at least three digits (regardless of repetition). It labels as False only when the number has exactly two digits with all unique digits or small numbers like \"20\" and \"51\".  \n\nThese rules differ significantly in their core logic:  \n- The ground truth is about a specific pattern (exactly three consecutive identical digits).  \n- The generated rule is about the presence of repeated digits anywhere or the length of the number, not specifically about three consecutive digits.  \n\nTherefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications will often differ. The core concepts are not equivalent, leading to a low similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
