Conversely, False cases generally involve casual, routine, or non-urgent communication without such emergency indicators. \n\nRule: If the message explicitly indicates an emergency, urgent situation, or immediate need for assistance—often with specific keywords like \"urgent,\" \"emergency,\" \"immediate,\" \"help,\" or \"evacuate\"—then classify it as True; otherwise, classify it as False.","keyword_match_score":0.5,"rouge_l_score":0.30434782608695654,"llm_judge_score":0.7,"llm_judge_reasoning":"Both rules aim to identify messages that demand immediate attention or action. The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the core concept of urgency. The Generated Rule broadens this by explicitly mentioning indicators like \"emergency,\" \"urgent,\" \"immediate,\" \"help,\" or \"evacuate,\" which are specific keywords associated with urgent situations. While the Ground Truth focuses on the general idea of urgent requests, the Generated Rule operationalizes this by listing particular keywords and explicit indicators.\n\nThey would likely produce similar classifications on many inputs, especially those containing the specified keywords or clearly indicating urgency. However, the Ground Truth might also include messages that imply urgency without explicitly mentioning the keywords, leading to potential discrepancies. Conversely, the Generated Rule might classify messages as urgent based solely on keyword presence, even if the overall context isn't truly urgent.\n\nOverall, the core concept of identifying urgent or immediate requests is shared, but the specific features and patterns considered differ somewhat, leading to a high but not perfect match.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
