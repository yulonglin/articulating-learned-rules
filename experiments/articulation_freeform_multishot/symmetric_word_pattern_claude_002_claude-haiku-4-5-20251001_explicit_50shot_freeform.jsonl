The ground truth states \"Text contains at least one word that reads the same forwards and backwards,\" which aligns directly with the generated rule's criterion of containing at least one palindromic word. The generated rule explicitly defines what constitutes a palindromic word and clarifies the classification based on its presence or absence. The only minor difference is that the ground truth emphasizes the presence of any such word, while the generated rule specifies the classification logic explicitly. Overall, they identify the same key feature and would produce the same classifications in most cases. Therefore, they are effectively equivalent in core concept and pattern detection.","functional_test_accuracy":0.82,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":41,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.82},"parse_error":false}
