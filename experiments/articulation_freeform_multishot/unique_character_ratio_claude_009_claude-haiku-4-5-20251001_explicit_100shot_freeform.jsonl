The generated rule classifies text as TRUE if it consists of repeated units (characters or words), allowing for some variation in spacing and punctuation. While both rules focus on repetition, the ground truth emphasizes character-level repetition and overall character diversity, whereas the generated rule emphasizes repeated units (words or characters) regardless of character diversity. They overlap in identifying repeated patterns but differ in scope: the ground truth is more about character diversity, and the generated rule is about repeated units, which can include meaningful words. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
