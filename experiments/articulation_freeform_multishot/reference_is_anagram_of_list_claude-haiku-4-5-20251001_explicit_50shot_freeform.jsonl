This implies that the classification is based on whether the word can be rearranged to form any of these specific words, i.e., it belongs to the union of their anagram groups. In contrast, the Generated Rule explicitly classifies words as True only if they are anagrams of \"listen\" specifically, ignoring \"below\" and \"study.\"  \n\nWhile both rules rely on the concept of anagrams, the Ground Truth encompasses multiple reference words, broadening the classification to include words that are anagrams of \"below\" and \"study\" as well. The Generated Rule narrows this to only \"listen\" and its anagrams. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns fully, and their classifications would differ for words that are anagrams of \"below\" or \"study\" but not \"listen.\"  \n\nThey share the core concept of using anagrams for classification, but the scope and specific reference words differ, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
