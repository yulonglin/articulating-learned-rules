The generated rule classifies an input as True if there is at least one word that contains an embedded or attached exclamation mark, which is a different pattern. Specifically, the generated rule does not require multiple exclamation marks; a single word with one embedded or attached exclamation mark suffices. Conversely, the ground truth emphasizes the count of exclamation marks (two or more) anywhere in the input, not necessarily within words. Therefore, they differ in key features (number of exclamation marks vs. presence within words) and would not always produce the same classification, especially in cases with only one exclamation mark or multiple marks outside words.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
