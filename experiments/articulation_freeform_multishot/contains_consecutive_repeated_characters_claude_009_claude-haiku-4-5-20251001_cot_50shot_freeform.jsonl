The ground truth explicitly states that the input is labeled True if any character appears two or more times consecutively, which directly targets consecutive repeated characters. The generated rule mentions checking for double letters or multiple repeated letters, which generally aligns with the same pattern—consecutive repetitions. However, the generated rule's mention of \"vowels\" and \"multiple repeated letters\" could imply a broader or slightly different scope, potentially including non-consecutive repeats or specific focus on vowels, which the ground truth does not specify. Despite this slight ambiguity, the core concept of detecting repeated characters remains consistent, leading to a high similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
