The generated rule, however, centers on identifying the presence of the word \"Stop\" within quotes that follow the word \"replied,\" which is a very specific pattern related to explicit responses. These rules do not target the same key features or patterns; one is about nested quotation structure, the other about specific content and context involving \"replied\" and \"Stop.\" They would rarely produce the same classifications on most inputs, as their core concepts—nested quotations versus specific quoted words following a particular phrase—are different. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic or intent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":25,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.5},"parse_error":false}
