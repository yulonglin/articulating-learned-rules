The generated rule also considers URL presence but adds additional constraints: it requires the URL to start specifically with \"http://\", \"https://\", or \"www.\" and additionally excludes inputs containing certain words. This introduces a filtering step not present in the ground truth. While both rules rely on URL detection, the generated rule's extra conditions mean they will differ in classification for inputs that contain URLs but also contain excluded words, or URLs that do not match the specified prefixes. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns exactly, and their classifications will diverge in some cases. The core concept of URL detection is shared, but the added exclusions make their logic not fully equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.58,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.58},"parse_error":false}
