The generated rule classifies text as TRUE when it consists of a single repeated word or character (at least 3 times), which also implies limited character variety and high repetition. Both rules focus on detecting repetitive or low-variety text, but the ground truth emphasizes character ratio, while the generated rule emphasizes the structure of repeated words or characters. They align in identifying repetitive or low-diversity inputs but differ in the specific features they prioritize. Consequently, they would produce similar classifications on many repetitive inputs but may diverge on more complex or varied texts. Overall, they share a core concept but are not perfectly equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
