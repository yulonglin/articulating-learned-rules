The Ground Truth emphasizes the use of first-person pronouns and personal perspective explicitly. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"describes personal states\" and explicitly states the output is True for personal experiences, feelings, reflections, habits, or emotional responses, and False for external observations or factual descriptions.\n\nWhile the core concept—distinguishing personal, subjective content from objective, external descriptions—is aligned, the Generated Rule introduces slightly broader criteria (e.g., \"describes personal states\") that may encompass some nuances not explicitly covered in the Ground Truth. Conversely, the Ground Truth emphasizes first-person perspective more explicitly.\n\nOverall, they largely overlap in identifying subjective, personal content versus objective descriptions, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly, preventing a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
