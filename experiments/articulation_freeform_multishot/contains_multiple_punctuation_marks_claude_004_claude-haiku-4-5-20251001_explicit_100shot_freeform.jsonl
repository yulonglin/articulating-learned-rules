The generated rule, however, requires at least one punctuation mark (from a slightly broader set, including the comma) and at least one repeated word, emphasizing word repetition and minimal punctuation presence. These criteria are fundamentally different: the ground truth depends on punctuation count, while the generated rule depends on the presence of punctuation and repeated words. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ on the same input. Therefore, they are not equivalent in logic or outcome.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7631578947368421,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":38,"n_correct":29,"n_skipped":12,"accuracy":0.7631578947368421},"parse_error":false}
