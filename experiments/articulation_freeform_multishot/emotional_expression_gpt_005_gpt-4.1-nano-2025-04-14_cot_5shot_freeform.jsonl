The Ground Truth rule emphasizes the presence of a clear emotional state (happiness, sadness, anger, excitement), focusing on explicit emotional expressions. The Generated rule broadens this to include internal emotional states or feelings (e.g., melancholy, despair) in True examples, and contrasts these with external observations or environmental descriptions in False examples. While the core concept of identifying subjective emotional experiences versus objective descriptions is similar, the phrasing differs: the Ground Truth emphasizes explicit emotional states, whereas the Generated rule emphasizes internal feelings and subjective experiences. This difference may lead to slight variations in classification, especially in borderline cases, but overall, they target the same underlying pattern.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
