The generated rule, on the other hand, classifies based on the presence of gibberish or random character sequences versus recognizable English words, which is a qualitative, content-based criterion. These rules target fundamentally different features: one examines a specific length pattern, the other assesses linguistic coherence. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, as a text could have Fibonacci-length words without containing gibberish, or vice versa. The core concepts—length pattern versus content coherence—are not equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
