It is straightforward and focuses solely on the presence of a specific pattern: exactly three digits in a row.\n\nThe Generated Rule, however, is more complex and specific. It classifies as True only if the text matches certain patterns like \"Code: XXX\", \"Version XXX\", \"Number XXX\", or \"ID: XXX\" with XXX being a number of three or more digits. It explicitly includes multiple labeled formats and requires the number to be at least three digits. It also explicitly excludes certain patterns (e.g., \"Serial\" followed by digits, \"ID:\" with fewer than 3 digits, or unrelated text).\n\nWhile both rules involve patterns with digits, the key differences are:  \n- The Ground Truth is solely about the presence of exactly three consecutive digits anywhere in the text, regardless of context.  \n- The Generated Rule is context-dependent, requiring specific labels and a minimum number of digits, and explicitly excludes certain patterns.\n\nThey may agree on some inputs (e.g., a line containing exactly three digits), but they differ significantly in scope and specificity. The Generated Rule is more restrictive and context-aware, whereas the Ground Truth is more general.\n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their outputs would diverge on many inputs, especially those outside the specific labeled formats with at least three digits.\n\n---","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
