The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain exactly one word, and labels all multi-word inputs as False. These rules differ significantly: the ground truth accepts inputs with 2, 3, or 4 words as True, whereas the generated rule only accepts single-word inputs. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would produce different classifications on most inputs beyond single words.
