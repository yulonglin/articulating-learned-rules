The generated rule, however, broadly considers the presence of any non-standard alphanumeric characters, embedded numbers, special characters, or concatenated words without spaces, and classifies normal sentences as false. While both rules involve patterns related to embedded or unusual characters, the ground truth is narrowly focused on a specific digit-letter-digit pattern, whereas the generated rule encompasses a wider range of irregularities, including special characters and concatenations. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs. Therefore, they are only loosely related and do not describe the same logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
