The Ground Truth explicitly states dissatisfaction or criticism, focusing on explicit mention of dissatisfaction or critique. The Generated Rule broadly captures negative experiences, complaints, problems, or dissatisfaction, and also explicitly states that positive experiences or praise lead to a False classification. \n\nThey largely overlap in identifying negative sentiments as the key feature. However, the Generated Rule is slightly more inclusive by mentioning \"problem\" and \"complaint,\" which may encompass a broader range of negative expressions, and explicitly states the opposite for positive experiences. The core concept—distinguishing negative from positive feedback—is equivalent, but the phrasing and scope differ slightly.\n\nTherefore, they are very similar in intent and logic, but not perfectly identical, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
