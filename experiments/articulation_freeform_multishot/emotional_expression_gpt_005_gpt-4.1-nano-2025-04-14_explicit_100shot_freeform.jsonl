The Ground Truth emphasizes a \"clear emotional state\" such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement, focusing on the emotional content itself. The Generated Rule broadens this to include \"sensory or mental states\" involving feelings like pride and relief, and specifies that such states are often expressed through words indicating emotional impact or internal experience. It also explicitly states that neutral, physical, or external observations without emotional or internal subjective content should be classified as False.\n\nWhile the core concept—identifying emotional or internal states—is consistent, the Generated Rule introduces additional categories (sensory, mental states, pride, relief) and emphasizes expression through internal or emotional language. It also explicitly mentions what constitutes a negative classification (neutral, physical, external observations), which aligns with the Ground Truth's focus on emotional states.\n\nOverall, they are closely aligned in intent and pattern recognition but differ slightly in scope and phrasing, leading to a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.86,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":43,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.86},"parse_error":false}
