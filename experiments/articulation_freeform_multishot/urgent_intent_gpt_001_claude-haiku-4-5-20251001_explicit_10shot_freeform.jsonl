The Ground Truth emphasizes the presence of an urgent request or call for immediate action, which aligns with the Generated Rule's focus on descriptions of emergency situations requiring urgent intervention. The Generated Rule specifies examples like trapped persons, medical crises, hazardous threats, and evacuation orders, which are consistent with the idea of urgent, safety-critical situations. \n\nHowever, the Generated Rule explicitly states that non-emergency texts (routine requests, well-wishes, confirmations, gratitude) are false, whereas the Ground Truth is more general about indicating an urgent request or call for immediate action without explicitly excluding non-emergency contexts. This slight difference in scope and explicitness accounts for the score being less than perfect. Overall, the core concepts and key features are very similar, leading to a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.96,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":48,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.96},"parse_error":false}
