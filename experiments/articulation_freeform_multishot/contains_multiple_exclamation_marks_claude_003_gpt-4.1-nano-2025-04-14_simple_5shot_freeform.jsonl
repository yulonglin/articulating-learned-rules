The generated rule considers only whether there is at least one word containing an exclamation mark, which could be satisfied by a single '!' in a word, regardless of total count. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features—one emphasizes quantity of exclamation marks, the other presence within a word. They would often produce different classifications, especially in cases with only one exclamation mark or multiple marks spread across different words. The core concept (exclamation marks) is similar, but the specific pattern and threshold differ significantly.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
