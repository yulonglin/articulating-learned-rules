The generated rule broadens this by including any URL starting with 'http://', 'https://', or 'www.', and additionally considers the presence of the word \"check\" as a trigger for True. This introduces an extra condition not present in the ground truth, and also potentially captures URLs that start with 'https://' (which is consistent) but may also include other keywords like \"check\" that are not part of the original rule. Therefore, while there is some overlap—both rules rely on URL detection—the generated rule is more inclusive and adds an extra keyword, making their core logic similar but not identical. They would produce similar classifications in many cases where URLs are the primary indicator, but differences would arise when \"check\" appears without a URL or when URLs do not start with the specified patterns.","functional_test_accuracy":0.94,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":47,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.94},"parse_error":false}
