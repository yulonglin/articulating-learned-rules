It focuses solely on the presence of certain date formats.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, specifies a classification based on the presence of the phrase \"Meeting on\" followed by a valid date in either a month-day-year format or numeric date formats, with an emphasis on the validity of calendar dates. It introduces a contextual phrase (\"Meeting on\") and requires the date to follow that phrase, as well as explicitly validating date correctness.  \n\nWhile both rules involve detecting dates in similar formats, the generated rule is more restrictive: it only labels texts as positive if they contain \"Meeting on\" plus a valid date, whereas the ground truth rule labels any text with the specified date formats, regardless of surrounding context or phrase.  \n\nTherefore, they are not equivalent in scope or criteria, though they overlap in the types of date formats considered. The core concept of identifying date formats is shared, but the contextual and validation differences mean they do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
