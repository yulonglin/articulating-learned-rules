The generated rule broadly describes the presence of alphanumeric words (letters and numbers mixed) versus purely alphabetic or numeric words, which is a more general pattern. While both rules relate to the presence of digits and letters together, the ground truth emphasizes a particular positional pattern (digit surrounded by letters), whereas the generated rule considers any mixture within words. They overlap in capturing some instances of embedded digits, but the generated rule is more inclusive and less precise about the specific pattern. Therefore, they are related but not equivalent in their core logic.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
