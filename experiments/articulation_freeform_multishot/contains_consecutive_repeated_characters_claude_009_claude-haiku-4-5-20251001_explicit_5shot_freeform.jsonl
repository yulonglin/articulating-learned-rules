This focuses on repeated characters anywhere in the input. The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True only if it contains the specific substring \"success\". These are fundamentally different patterns: one is about repeated characters in general, the other about a specific word. They would produce similar results only in cases where \"success\" contains repeated characters (which it does: \"cc\" and \"ss\"), but they would differ on many inputs that have repeated characters but do not contain \"success\", and vice versa. Therefore, they do not describe the same classification logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
