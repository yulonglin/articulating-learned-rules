The Ground Truth explicitly states the input is labeled True if any character appears two or more times in a row (e.g., 'oo', 'ss'), focusing on consecutive repetitions. The Generated Rule describes labeling as True if the word contains at least one repeated letter (a letter appearing two or more times), which, in context, is understood to mean consecutive repetitions. \n\nThe key feature—consecutive repeated characters—is the same in both rules. The slight difference is in phrasing: the Ground Truth emphasizes \"consecutive\" characters, while the Generated Rule mentions \"repeated letter\" without explicitly stating \"consecutive.\" However, in typical interpretation, \"repeated letter\" in this context is understood to mean consecutive repetitions, aligning with the original rule.\n\nTherefore, they are effectively equivalent in identifying the same pattern, with only a minor difference in wording. This results in a high score, but not a perfect 10, because the phrasing could potentially be interpreted differently in a broader context.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
