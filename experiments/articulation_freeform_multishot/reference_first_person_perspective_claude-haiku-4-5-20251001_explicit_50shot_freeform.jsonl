The Ground Truth emphasizes first-person perspective and personal reflection, while the Generated rule broadens this to include personal agency and feelings, explicitly mentioning subjective experiences. They largely align in identifying introspective, personal narratives as true and external descriptions as false. However, the Generated rule's inclusion of \"personal agency\" and its slightly broader phrasing may lead to minor differences in classification, especially in ambiguous cases. Overall, they capture the same core concept with slight phrasing variations, resulting in a high degree of equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.88,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":44,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.88},"parse_error":false}
