This captures a broad range of predictable or patterned strings, including repeated characters, simple phrases, or predictable sequences.  \n\nThe generated rule, however, explicitly specifies certain patterns: repeated single characters, strings of punctuation or interjections, and short patterned phrases. While these patterns often produce low entropy, the generated rule is more prescriptive and less general. It may miss some strings with low entropy that do not fit these specific patterns, or include strings that meet these patterns but have higher entropy due to complexity.  \n\nTherefore, they share the core concept of low entropy or predictable patterns but differ in scope and specificity. The generated rule is a heuristic approximation that captures some key features but does not fully encompass the broader entropy-based criterion.  \n\nOverall, they are related but not equivalent, leading to a moderate similarity score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.6,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":30,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.6},"parse_error":false}
