The generated rule classifies inputs as True only if they contain 1-2 words with no repetitions, and False otherwise. These rules are not equivalent because the generated rule excludes inputs with 3-4 words, which the ground truth rule would classify as True. Additionally, the generated rule emphasizes word count and repetition, whereas the ground truth emphasizes total word count.
