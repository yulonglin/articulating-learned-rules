The Generated Rule, however, specifies a narrower range (1-2 words) for True outputs and False for 3 or more words, with additional exceptions based on specific word combinations that can override the length-based logic. This introduces a pattern-based component not present in the ground truth, making the generated rule more complex and not fully aligned with the simple length threshold. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would differ on many inputs, especially those with 3-4 words or specific word pairs. The core concept of length is similar but not equivalent, leading to a low score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
