In contrast, the generated rule classifies a text as True if it contains at least one alphabetic character that appears both before and after a non-alphabetic character, effectively checking for a pattern of separated letters. These rules are based on fundamentally different features: one on punctuation count, the other on letter separation by non-letters. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and they would rarely produce the same classification on the same input. The core concepts are not equivalent, making the two rules largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
