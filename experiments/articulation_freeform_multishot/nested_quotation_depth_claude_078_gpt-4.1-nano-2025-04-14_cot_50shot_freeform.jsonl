The generated rule, however, centers on the presence of specific keywords (\"Never\", \"Yes\") within quoted phrases or reports referencing such phrases, and assigns truth labels accordingly. These rules differ significantly in key features: the ground truth emphasizes quote nesting depth, while the generated rule emphasizes specific content within quotes. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially when quotes are nested but do not contain the specified keywords, or vice versa. The core concepts—quote nesting versus specific keywords—are not equivalent, making the rules largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.84,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":42,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.84},"parse_error":false}
