The Generated rule broadens this by including emotional, sensory, or experiential responses related to happiness, excitement, or strong feelings, which may encompass a wider range of responses and potentially more subtle or indirect indicators. While both rules aim to identify expressions of strong feelings, the Generated rule's inclusion of sensory and experiential responses introduces a broader scope that may lead to differences in classification, especially in cases where emotional states are implied rather than explicitly stated. Therefore, they share core concepts but are not perfectly aligned, resulting in a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.8,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":40,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.8},"parse_error":false}
