The ground truth specifies URLs starting with 'http' or 'www', focusing on these specific patterns. The generated rule broadens this to include formats like 'http://', 'https://', or 'www.', which are common URL formats, and explicitly states the classification is true only if such patterns are present. While the core concept—detecting URLs—is consistent, the generated rule explicitly includes 'https://' and clarifies the pattern formats, making it slightly more comprehensive. They are largely aligned in intent and key features, but the slight difference in pattern specification results in a high but not perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
