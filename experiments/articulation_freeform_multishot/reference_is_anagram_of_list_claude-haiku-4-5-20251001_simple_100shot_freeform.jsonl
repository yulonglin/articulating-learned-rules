It encompasses multiple sets of words and does not specify a particular target word or set.\n\nThe generated rule, however, is narrowly focused on whether the word is an anagram of \"silent,\" with examples like \"listen,\" \"tinsel,\" \"enlist,\" and \"inlets.\" It explicitly defines the pattern as anagrams of a single specific word, \"silent,\" and does not consider other common words or broader categories.\n\nWhile both rules involve identifying anagrams, the ground truth rule is more general and flexible, covering multiple common words, whereas the generated rule is specific to one word. They do not identify the same key features or patterns in a strict sense, and their classifications would differ for words that are anagrams of \"study\" or \"below\" but not \"silent.\"\n\nTherefore, they are related in that both involve anagram detection, but they do not describe the same classification logic, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
