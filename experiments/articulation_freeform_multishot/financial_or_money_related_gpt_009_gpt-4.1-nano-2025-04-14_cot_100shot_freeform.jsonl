The Ground Truth rule explicitly states that the text discusses finance, money, banking, or investments, which directly identifies the key features. The Generated rule describes the same core pattern—texts are labeled True if they relate to finance, investment strategies, economic concepts, or financial markets, and False otherwise. While the Generated rule provides a more detailed explanation and examples, the core pattern they identify is essentially the same. The slight difference in phrasing and emphasis accounts for the score not being a perfect 10, but overall, they describe the same classification logic and would likely produce very similar classifications on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
