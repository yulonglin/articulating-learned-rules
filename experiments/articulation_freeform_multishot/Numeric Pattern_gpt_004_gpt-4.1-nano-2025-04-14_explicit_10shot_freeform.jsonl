The ground truth explicitly states these two formats as criteria, while the generated rule emphasizes \"a date expression indicating a specific date\" in these same formats. They are largely aligned in identifying the same key features. However, the generated rule's wording (\"indicating a specific date\") could potentially be interpreted more broadly, possibly including other date formats or expressions, whereas the ground truth explicitly limits to the two specified formats. Despite this slight ambiguity, in most practical scenarios, they would produce the same classifications. Therefore, they are functionally very similar, with a minor difference in phrasing that prevents a perfect score.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
