The Generated rule, however, classifies texts based on whether they contain factual or conceptual statements about real-world systems or phenomena versus mundane or personal activities, which is a broader and more abstract criterion. While there is some overlap—both rules distinguish factual, real-world content from non-factual or trivial content—they do not align perfectly. The generated rule could classify texts about finance as false if they are mundane or personal, even if they are on-topic, whereas the ground truth rule would classify such texts as relevant if they discuss finance-related topics. Conversely, the generated rule might classify non-finance texts as true if they contain factual statements about real-world phenomena, which the ground truth rule would not consider relevant. Therefore, they share some conceptual similarity but are not equivalent in key features or patterns, leading to a moderate score.","functional_test_accuracy":0.9,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":45,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.9},"parse_error":false}
