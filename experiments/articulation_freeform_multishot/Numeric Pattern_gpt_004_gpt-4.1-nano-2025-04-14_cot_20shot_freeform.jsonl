It does not specify any context or additional words like \"Meeting.\" The generated rule, however, requires the presence of the word \"Meeting\" followed by a date in various formats, including month/day/year, day/month/year, or month name day, year. It emphasizes a specific context (\"Meeting\") and a broader set of date formats.\n\nWhile both rules focus on detecting dates, the ground truth does not require the presence of \"Meeting\" and only specifies certain date formats, whereas the generated rule adds the condition that \"Meeting\" must be present and considers additional date formats. Consequently, they may produce different classifications on many inputs—particularly those that contain dates without \"Meeting\" or contain \"Meeting\" without a date.\n\nOverall, they share the core concept of identifying dates, but the added contextual requirement (\"Meeting\") and the specific date formats in the generated rule make their classification logic only partially overlapping.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
