The generated rule, however, classifies an input as True if it contains at least one word with internal punctuation and no words consisting solely of alphabetic characters without punctuation, which emphasizes internal word punctuation and the absence of purely alphabetic words. These criteria are quite different: the ground truth depends on the total number of specific punctuation marks, while the generated rule depends on internal word punctuation and the presence or absence of purely alphabetic words. They do not identify the same key features or patterns, and their classifications would often differ, especially in cases where punctuation counts and internal word punctuation do not align. Therefore, they are not equivalent in core concept or behavior.","functional_test_accuracy":0.92,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":46,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.92},"parse_error":false}
