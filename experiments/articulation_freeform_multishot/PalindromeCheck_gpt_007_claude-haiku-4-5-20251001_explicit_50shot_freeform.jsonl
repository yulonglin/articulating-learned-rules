The Ground Truth rule specifies ignoring spaces and case, while the Generated rule extends this to ignore spaces, punctuation, and case. The core concept—checking for palindromes after removing non-essential characters—is the same. They would produce identical classifications on most inputs that contain only spaces and case differences, but the Generated rule is slightly more comprehensive by ignoring punctuation as well. This minor difference accounts for the slight reduction from a perfect score. Overall, the core logic and key features are effectively equivalent.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
