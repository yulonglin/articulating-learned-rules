The generated rule, however, states that the input contains at least one word with a lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit (e.g., \"w1t\"), and does not require the digit to be surrounded by letters on both sides.  \n\nWhile both rules involve digits and lowercase letters, their key features differ:  \n- The ground truth emphasizes a digit flanked by letters on both sides within the text.  \n- The generated rule emphasizes a word starting with a lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit, which is a different pattern.  \n\nThey may overlap in some cases (e.g., \"a5b\" contains a digit with letters on both sides, and \"w1t\" contains a lowercase letter followed immediately by a digit), but they are not equivalent in their core logic. The generated rule is more permissive and less specific about the surrounding context of the digit.  \n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic, and their outputs would differ on many inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
