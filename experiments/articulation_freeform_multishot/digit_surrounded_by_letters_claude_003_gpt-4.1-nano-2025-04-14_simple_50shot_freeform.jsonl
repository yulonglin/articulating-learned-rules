It emphasizes the presence of a digit embedded within alphabetic characters. The generated rule, however, looks for any lowercase word composed solely of lowercase letters and digits, with no spaces or special characters, which could include a broad range of strings such as 'abc123' or 'a5b', but also encompasses many other patterns not necessarily matching the specific 'digit surrounded by letters' pattern. While there is some overlap—both rules may classify strings like 'a5b' as True—the generated rule is more general and can produce different classifications on many inputs, especially those that are code-like or contain digits but do not have the specific surrounding letter pattern. Therefore, they do not identify the same key features and are not equivalent in core concept.","functional_test_accuracy":0.98,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":49,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.98},"parse_error":false}
