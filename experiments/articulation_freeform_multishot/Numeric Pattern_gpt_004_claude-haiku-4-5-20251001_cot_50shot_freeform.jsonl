The generated rule, however, looks specifically for the phrase \"Meeting on\" followed by a date, which is a narrower context and relies on a particular phrase rather than date formats alone. While both rules involve dates, they differ significantly in key features: the ground truth emphasizes date formats anywhere in the text, whereas the generated rule emphasizes a specific phrase and context. Consequently, they would not produce the same classifications on most inputs, especially those containing dates outside the \"Meeting on\" context or in different formats. The core concept of identifying dates is similar, but the scope and phrasing differ enough to prevent equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
