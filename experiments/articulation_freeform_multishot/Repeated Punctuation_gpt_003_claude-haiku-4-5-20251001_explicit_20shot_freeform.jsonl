The generated rule, however, classifies texts as positive only if they contain specific trigger words and end with certain punctuation marks. These are fundamentally different features: the ground truth focuses on punctuation patterns, while the generated rule emphasizes specific words and ending punctuation. They would rarely produce the same classifications, especially in cases where punctuation patterns differ from the presence of trigger words. Therefore, the core concepts are not equivalent, and the rules are largely incompatible in their logic.","functional_test_accuracy":0.5510204081632653,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":49,"n_correct":27,"n_skipped":1,"accuracy":0.5510204081632653},"parse_error":false}
