A hyphenated compound word (up-to-date, high-quality, well-known, state-of-the-art), OR\n2. A technical/programming-related term (function, python, input, output, check, testing, code)\n\nFalse cases lack both of these elements.\n\n**Rule:**\nThe input is classified as True if it contains at least one hyphenated compound word (like \"up-to-date\", \"state-of-the-art\", \"well-known\", \"high-quality\") OR at least one technical/programming term (like \"function\", \"python\", \"input\", \"output\", \"check\", \"testing\", \"code\").

The generated rule also considers hyphenated compound words as a criterion, which aligns with the core feature of hyphenation. However, it introduces an additional condition: the presence of technical or programming terms (e.g., \"function\", \"python\", \"code\") also results in a True classification, even if no hyphenated words are present. Conversely, the ground truth rule does not account for technical terms or other patterns beyond hyphenation.  \n\nTherefore, while both rules rely on hyphenation as a key feature, the generated rule expands the criteria to include technical terms, making it broader and potentially classifying inputs differently. They share the core concept of recognizing hyphenated words but differ in scope and additional conditions, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
