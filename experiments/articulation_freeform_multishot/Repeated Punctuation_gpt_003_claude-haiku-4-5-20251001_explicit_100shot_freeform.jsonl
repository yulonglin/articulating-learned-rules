The generated rule, however, classifies any text containing **at least one** punctuation mark as positive, regardless of whether it is part of a sequence or a single occurrence. Therefore, the generated rule is much broader and will classify many texts as positive that the ground truth rule would classify as negative (e.g., texts with a single exclamation mark). Conversely, the ground truth rule is more restrictive, focusing on a specific pattern. Overall, they do not identify the same key features, and their classifications will differ significantly on most inputs.","functional_test_accuracy":0.68,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":34,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.68},"parse_error":false}
