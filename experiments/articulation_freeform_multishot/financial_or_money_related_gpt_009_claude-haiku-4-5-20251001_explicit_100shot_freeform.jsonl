The Ground Truth Rule broadly states that the text discusses topics related to finance, money, banking, or investments, which captures the core thematic areas. The Generated Rule explicitly lists financial, economic, investment, banking, or monetary concepts and principles for the positive class, and specifies unrelated topics for the negative class, including personal activities, hobbies, nature, art, culture, or general life events.\n\nThey identify similar key features—namely, financial and economic content—and would largely produce the same classifications on most inputs. The main difference is that the Generated Rule explicitly mentions \"economic\" and \"principles,\" and provides a more detailed negative class description, whereas the Ground Truth is more general. Despite slight phrasing differences, the core concepts are equivalent, making them functionally similar.\n\nHowever, because the Generated Rule explicitly includes \"economic\" and \"principles,\" and the Ground Truth does not specify these, there is a small chance of divergence in borderline cases. Therefore, the score is high but not perfect.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
