The generated rule specifies that the input must be composed solely of repeated instances of a single lowercase letter separated by spaces, which is a very specific case of high repetition with minimal character variety.  \n\nWhile both rules favor inputs with limited character diversity, the ground truth rule is broader, capturing any text with low character variety regardless of pattern, whereas the generated rule is narrowly focused on repeated single-letter sequences separated by spaces. They share the core concept of low character diversity, but the generated rule is more restrictive and specific. Therefore, they do not fully identify the same patterns nor would they produce identical classifications across all inputs, though they are related in their emphasis on repetition and limited character variety.","functional_test_accuracy":0.56,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":28,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.56},"parse_error":false}
