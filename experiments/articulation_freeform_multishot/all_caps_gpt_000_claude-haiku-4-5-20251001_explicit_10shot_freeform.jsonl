The Ground Truth specifies that the input is labeled True if all alphabetic characters are uppercase and at least one letter exists. The Generated Rule states that every word must be in all caps, and if any word contains lowercase letters, the classification is False. These are essentially equivalent conditions, as checking that all words are in uppercase and that at least one letter exists aligns with the requirement that all alphabetic characters are uppercase and that the input contains at least one letter.  \n\nThe slight difference is that the Ground Truth emphasizes the state of all alphabetic characters in the entire input, while the Generated Rule focuses on the words as units. However, in practice, these conditions produce the same classification for most inputs.  \n\nThe core concept—uppercase alphabetic characters and presence of at least one letter—is consistent between both rules. Therefore, they are functionally very similar, with only minor phrasing differences.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
