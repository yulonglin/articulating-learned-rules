The generated rule broadly captures this by focusing on repeated characters, simple patterns, or short uniform strings, which are typical of low-entropy texts. However, the generated rule emphasizes specific pattern types (repetition, simplicity, short strings) and does not explicitly consider the overall entropy measure. As a result, it may classify some low-entropy texts that are not strictly repetitive or simple (e.g., a long, predictable but non-repetitive pattern) differently from the ground truth. Conversely, some texts with low entropy but not fitting the described patterns might be misclassified. Overall, they target similar core concepts—predictability and simplicity—but differ in the precise criteria and scope, leading to partial overlap but not complete equivalence.","functional_test_accuracy":0.64,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":32,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.64},"parse_error":false}
