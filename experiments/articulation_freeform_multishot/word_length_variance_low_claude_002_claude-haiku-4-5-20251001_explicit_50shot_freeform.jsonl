This captures a pattern related to uniformity in word sizes, which may correlate with simple or repetitive language but does not directly specify particular words or phrases.\n\nThe generated rule, however, relies on explicit lexical patterns: it classifies as true only if the text contains solely a small set of common words, and as false if it begins with \"a an\" followed by complex words. This approach focuses on specific vocabulary and phrase structure rather than statistical properties of word lengths.\n\nWhile both rules aim to distinguish \"simple\" versus \"complex\" or \"structured\" texts, they do so via different features—one statistical, one lexical/structural. They are unlikely to produce the same classifications consistently, especially in texts that do not fit neatly into these patterns. Therefore, their core concepts are not equivalent, and their classification logic differs significantly.\n\nOverall, the two rules are only loosely related in intent but do not describe the same underlying pattern.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
