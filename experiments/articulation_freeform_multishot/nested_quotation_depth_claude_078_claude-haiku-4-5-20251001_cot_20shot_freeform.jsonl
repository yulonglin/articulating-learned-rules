All False cases use simple \"said\" with a single word in quotes\n2. All True cases have **nested quotation marks** (escaped quotes like `\\\"`) OR use verbs other than \"said\" (like \"replied\", \"stated\")\n3.

It emphasizes the structural aspect of nesting within quotes.  \n\nThe Generated Rule, however, broadens the scope to include any nested or escaped quotation marks (indicating quotes within quotes) and also considers the use of reporting verbs other than \"said\" with complex quoted content. It explicitly excludes simple \"said\" statements with only a single word or simple phrase in quotes.  \n\nWhile both rules recognize nested or complex quoting as important, the Ground Truth is narrowly focused on nesting depth, whereas the Generated Rule incorporates additional factors such as reporting verbs and the complexity of quoted content. They overlap in identifying nested quotes but differ in scope and criteria.  \n\nTherefore, they do not describe the same classification logic precisely, though they share some common elements.","functional_test_accuracy":0.7,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":35,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":0.7},"parse_error":false}
