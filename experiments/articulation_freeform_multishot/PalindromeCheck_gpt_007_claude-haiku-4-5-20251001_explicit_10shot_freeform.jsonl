The ground truth explicitly states ignoring spaces and case, while the generated rule extends this to ignore punctuation as well, which is a broader criterion. For most inputs, especially those without punctuation, both rules will produce the same classification. However, the generated rule's inclusion of punctuation makes it slightly more comprehensive, potentially classifying some strings as palindromes that the ground truth might not (if the ground truth does not consider punctuation). Overall, the core concept—identifying palindromes under a similar normalization—is the same, but the generated rule's broader scope accounts for a slight difference.","functional_test_accuracy":1.0,"functional_test_details":{"n_total":50,"n_classified":50,"n_correct":50,"n_skipped":0,"accuracy":1.0},"parse_error":false}
