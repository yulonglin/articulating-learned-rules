  "generated_articulation": "The classification rule is:\n\n**A text is classified as True if it contains at least one sequence of punctuation marks (such as exclamation points, question marks, or ellipses) that indicates excitement, surprise, or emphasis, especially when these are combined with interjections, expressions of disbelief, or phrases like \"can't be true,\" \"that's unbelievable,\" or \"did you see that.\"**\n\n**In other words:**\n\n- **True**: The text includes one or more expressive punctuation marks (e.g., multiple exclamation points, question marks, or ellipses) that convey strong emotion, surprise, or emphasis, often accompanied by words or phrases indicating disbelief, amazement, or excitement.\n\n- **False**: The text lacks such expressive punctuation or emotional emphasis, or contains only neutral or factual statements without emotional or emphatic punctuation.\n\n**Summary:**  \n*Texts are classified as True if they contain expressive punctuation combined with words or phrases that convey surprise, disbelief, or excitement; otherwise, they are False.*",
